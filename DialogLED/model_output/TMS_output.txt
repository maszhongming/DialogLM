bridget decides to name their baby nicole. she and nick agree on the name. taylor spends the evening alone in the mausoleum, listening to music and daydreaming about ridge. she gets a call from hector who wants to come over, but she brushes him off. she is perfectly all alone and has to face herself, so it might as well be now. brooke continues to try to convince ridge that they belong together, but he says not any more. she tells him she was devastated when he told hope about their dream, but that dream is already dead. he begs her to give him some hope. ridge takes the kids to see the rain forest. he tells brooke that leaving her was the biggest mistake of his life, and he never realized just how much he hurt her until tonight. he says he never should have made that decision but he is trying to correct it now. he vows he will never let her down again. she says she is not ready for this.
rick tells hope that she should be furious with wyatt. she says she is. he knows he doesn't deserve a second chance but he is asking for their company's sake. their workers need their jobs and he does not want to punish them for something stupid that he did. liam catches quinn in the office and asks her to fire up the cauldron of her cauldron and make some wedding bands for him and hope. she tells him it is time for him to give up on that little dream. hope andwyatt went away together. he says he had no choice as hope was alone with a guy who was pretending to be something he wasn't. he did have his suspicions but he didn't have the proof. hope knows now. she has seen the footage and it is over for quinn and her son. quinn tells liam to give it a rest. he can just fly off to paris and make babies with steffy. he tells quinn that that footage does not define her son so it is all a big, fat, stinking lie perpetuated entirely by her own son. he's very sorry but he can't see him charming his way out of this one.
ridge tells brooke that he appreciates her daughter trying to be excited about steffy's new baby. brooke says she knows but she wonders how it will affect hope. she had so many questions and it was consuming her. so she thought it would be good for hope to meet the baby. ridge says they can worry about this as much as they want but it won't change anything. it will bring up a lot of feelings for brooke's daughter. taylor walks in and they are surprised to see her. she says she is sure they know by now about baby phoebe. but she 'd like to talk to ridge about hope's reaction. she knows hope is handling this well so far but she appreciates the effort she is making but it must be so painful for her to be reminded of what she lost. ridge tells her that he is proud of her. whatever happens between the three of them, the kids always come first. hope is still struggling but she has brooke and liam. and eventually hope will join in. reese tells zoe and tiffany that she doesn't have to worry about him anymore. he is head of security and he has everything under control. and he is counting on charlie to take care of his little girl and her friend there. zoe asks what is going on. he says that is part of why he came ; he is leaving l.a. and going back to london. he thinks it is for zoe's sake. he does not want to complicate her life any more than he has. he wishes it were that simple. he loves her more than anything. he will always be her dad and anytime she needs him he will come running. he tells
hope tells pam that she really did not have to do this for them. pam says of course she did as she made her favorite brownies, vegan for liam and vegan for hope. brooke and emma say they want to tell her how much she is missed. quinn and eric say she has a strong support system here. ridge tells taylor to tell steffy to take it easy ; they have enough grandbabies to go around. taylor and ridge hold phoebe and ridge says both of them are pretty special. he says he was not crazy about this whole adoption thing but look how amazing this is all because of her and her contact. zoe tells xander that her dad was deeply affected by the loss of hope's baby and she is sure he wasn't the same after that but she thinks there was something else going on and now she hopes she can find out what it was. she hopes he left something behind at his flat that will tell her what is going on. eric tells hope and liam that they have given so much to this company and it is time for some of that hope to come back to them. he wants to talk to her about her hftf line. he has been talking to ridge and he has made a few things more clear. he would like to get it revved up again and put more money into it. she is not sure this is the right time but if she would like that, it would benefit the entire company. he gives her a hug and says he hopes she will be okay with this. she asks her mother if she knew about this and brooke says yes but she did not want her to feel any pressure to rush back to work. er
katie and donna show up at brooke and hope's with breakfast. brooke says she can't believe they are bringing breakfast. katie says donna is not the boss of them but she does bring pastries. and besides croissants have eggs, flour and eggs, practically cereal. they all sit around the table playing card games. hope asks liam if he thinks kelly's hair will turn darker like phoebe's or if she will have dark hair like kelly. wyatt and sally drop in on steffy and they say they are neighbors and they ca not wait any longer to get a look at the new baby. xander is getting dressed and zoe tells him that it is a fashion house so there is hardly a room in here where someone is not getting changed. he needs to be an independent observer so he can see if all of this is paying off. she tells him about flo, her name is flo. she was open to other options like staying in touch with the birth mother but she did not want that. taylor is determined to close that chapter of her life. she knows what is right for her. he says life doesn't wait until you are ready. that must be how she wound up with him. she says she was not looking for a devastatingly handsome, charming boyfriend but she would rather have him. he tells sally that sometimes the spencer boys need to be put in their place. hope tells liam that she knows they want her to forget beth and move on but she can not do that. she does not think that is what she is really feeling. she can only tell them how she feels but it goes so much deeper than that she
brooke drops by nick's house bearing gifts for bridget. he's very proud of the way he is taking care of his little sister. brooke sees him with dominick and comments on how comfortable he is with him. bridget goes into active labor with felicia by her side. dr. caspary comes in and tells them there isn't enough time to save the baby, so they must let nature take its course. nick tells brooke that he is a blessed man, he has a son now and a daughter on the way. eric calls nick and tells him there is a problem at the hospital with bridget, he should go there right away. he leaves brooke to bring dominick. the doctor tries to save bridget's baby, but she dies before she can get the chance.
eric tells stephanie that her mother is her cross to bear, not eric's. it's not been fair to pam or ann and she needs to go back to her life in chicago. she had a right to know what he was going to do and he tells her now she is going to go inside and welcome her mother to l.a. she resents that he has placed her in an untenable position and she wants him to know she resent it. storm tells nick that harvey could be a recluse or just a dummy dba, guys this rich can appear and disappear whenever they want. nick wants storm to handle this with the sec as they don't like this kind of thing. phoebe tells rick that she is nauseous and he votes for the ride home. she doesn't want to hang herself from the rhododendron or hang herself with the paper shredders that could eat a whole house. he thinks she is taking this a little too hard, and he thinks shane is not worth it. she laments that she only went out with shane to see if rick would care, and then made a complete fool of herself, and now she does. she did not want him to leave before, but she does now. eric takes ann to santa monica and tells her if the condo is as nice as these pictures, he will take her to it first thing in the morning. right now he thinks there is something he wants to tell her. she's delighted in the thought of living close to her two girls, her grandchildren and her great - grandchildern and her handsome son - in - law.
liam holds eve and says she does not have to be afraid of him. he is better now. he can stand on his own most of the time. he does not know how he acted before but he knows how they met and fell in love and got married. he owes her so much. she says he is like a child who has never been hurt before and she used to be that way once. he says he likes her now so do not be sad or afraid. he asks if they had a fight before this happened or why does he feel like he is supposed to be here. he feels like there is a promise he made and he is not keeping it. she reminds him that he would be lost if he did not know their street or the city they live in. he keeps asking if they are divorced. there is nothing of him here. there are no photos of him in the apartment. she tells him that is better than showing him a bunch of pictures or stories that she made up. she is too controlling and does not want to be like that anymore. he wants her to tell him a story about her. katie tells bill that she is not going to sit here and fixate on brooke and that is not what she is going to do. she just spent a lovely afternoon with will. she wants to get a cat. he wonders why she wants an aloof feline in this house. she compares him to a national monument, he never changes. he quips that he needs to get one of his sons to commission a large bronze statue in the lobby of the hotel. she will start dropping hints but liam will roll his eyes and wyatt will be like what has bill done for her lately. bill says he has been pretty hands
ridge asks rick if he keeps his place in paris? he asks brooke if she is anxious for him to get back. he misses his friends and the places he used to hang out. ridge tells him he won't be missing them for long if the showing is as big as he thinks it will be they will need him back in europe real fast. brooke questions rick about staying up half the night with phoebe ; it looked like they were enjoying each other's company. he says the night did start off a little strange, but it ended up okay. he doesn't want to get into it. ridge calls jim to make sure everything is perfect for the showing tomorrow. stephanie tells ridge that he looks stressed. it's not the showing, but rick, and it might be an even bigger problem. ridge confides that he is more concerned about phoe be and rick's relationship and that it has become sexual. she suggests she go talk to brooke and perhaps she will understand ridge's point of view and do the right thing. nick tells storm they have no idea what kind of business they are walking into when golden calls and wants to meet with him alone. he wants to know who he is doing business with  is he golden or mr. marone? brooke tells rick that if there is something going on between him and phloe, he can tell her ; she does not need to pry into his life. rick says they are just getting to know each other, nothing serious, but he can talk to her and she is very wise for her age. he tells her that ridge is such a hypocrite after what he did with bridget. he
steffy tells liam that their marriage wasn't perfect, but she won't pretend that it was. it still is to her and she can't sign those annulment papers. he reminds her that he is thinking of her future and she doesn't want to get bogged down in this. she says she is in no hurry to get this over with and he shouldn't either. she hands him his keys and says she will take off her wedding ring when their divorce is final. she wants to indulge her passions, travel the world, have kids someday. hope is a station wagon ; she is a 1,200cc twin pipe - crotch rocket ready to burn rubber on that heart of his. taylor stops by and steffy asks her to lock the door as she is afraid that this is what is happening. she tells her mother that she tried to talk some sense into liam, but he walked out and he never signed the papers. hope tells ridge and brooke that she is not gloating. she just wants to show everyone that this story has a happy ending. she and liam are getting married tomorrow. liam shows up at the office and she tells him they can take the rest of the day off and they can get away. she can not contain herself ; they are a couple again. they are back together and hope for the future is back on track. she thanks all the people who have supported her over the last few months. she has a message for them  don't give up on your ideals. dignity and self - respect haven't gone out of style so find your moral center and take a stand on these next few days. he can not guarantee that things will turn out as well
deacon demands to know from quinn what is liam doing here. she tells him to keep his voice down ; liam is resting. he had an accident and hit his head twice on the airplane and then once in the parking lot at forrester and now has no memory. he does not know who she is or where he is or what happened. deacon is aghast that liam fell off the wagon and got a concussion, played nurse and now he has lost his memory and doesn't even know who quinn is. steffy has a flashback of wyatt telling her that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. thomas walks in and says it's about time she showed up. she wants to know who was looking for her. he asks where she's been. she says she has been playing hooky at the beach with wyatte, with him. he tells her that it is not that he is pressuring her or anything, but he wanted to tell her how he felt. he basically proposed to her. caroline asks why is he so distracted lately. he says maybe it is the divorce. she asks about liam and ivy and he says he is not like that and it never will be. he knows that now. he was not rushing to the altar. she is just wondering if he is really over liam or just trying to make herself be. she thinks they would be great together but she does not want to move on until she sees liam face to face and hears it from him himself. he reminds her that she is still in love with liam. she reminds him that she was supposed to be his wife and he asked her to marry him on the beach
brooke tells donna that she is going to get ridge back today. it's only a matter of time before he moves back in. she wants to teach caroline a lesson. donna is surprised since she thought brooke was over ridge long ago. brooke says she has loved him forever but she wants him back now. ridge is with caroline but brooke calls and says she needs to see him right away. bill tells liam that this is only phase one of their plan. they have a lot of hoops to jump through before they get control of fc. liam says they have to get rid of rick first and then control the company in some other way. he just hopes that wyatt can convince rick to give him his job back. bill says there is no way steffy will go behind her father's back. he is sure she will stay loyal to her dad. wyat tells rick that he said some things the other day that he regrets. he wasn't thinking. he didn't realize how important it is for him to stay here and that is why he is here now. he wants to come to rick man to man and ask for another chance. rick asks how bad does he want this job and if he doesn't then prove it by getting down on his knees and beg. he 'd like to hear him say that. he has been gone for way too long and neglected his work and rick had every right to call him out on it. he over - reacted and he is sorry and he will dedicate himself to this company to the betterment of this company. he gives rick his word that he will do whatever he wants him to do, but he
hope tells steffy to stop pushing her. she is proud to be a logan and proud of her family and she is not presumptuous to think she and liam are going to pick up where they left off months ago. brooke has engrained that mind set in her children to take what they want, whether it's liam or thomas or ridge's position in the company. taylor tells eric that she was not born a forrester, but neither was brooke and yet she walks around here behaving as if she is. it is like brooke is teaching her kids to be takers. marcus is shocked to find out from dayzee that maya was one of her clients and now she wants her baby back. dayzee explains that she thought she could handle it, but maya won't accept it. she was being convicted of a crime she swore she didn't commit and now maya is out of prison and wants her daughter back. it was a legal adoption and maya will not accept it and will not go away. she tells marcus and carter that she doesn't know what to do. eric tells taylor that he told her before that he is there for her. he says the forresters would not be who they are today if it weren't for taylor. she laments that she hates to see her daughter go through this. she wanted ridge to be with her, but brooke always came between them. and now brooke's daughter is doing the exact same thing to stephanie that she is doing to steffie. hope is entitled to all of this because her name is logan. hope says they have both come a long
liam calls steffy and asks if she is still at the office. she says no, she is at her condo. he says he is stuck at work and he just called to talk. he doesn't want her to think that his feelings have changed or that they have to start avoiding each other. she reminds him that he asked for the space and she gave it to him, so he needs to take it. hope came to see him today, but that is a bad idea. he's not saying this is the end, but it might be. hope tells rick that his day of reckoning has arrived and she is there to collect. she needs his help with liam. she wants him to know there will be no more friction in the forrester family ; things will run smooth for them too. he asks what he can do to help. hope says apologize to him. he slugged him and he tried that, but he didn't take it well so she needs to try again. liam needs to know that things will be different. in this family, there will not be any more friction. he made it so easy to choose hope and she wants it to be that way with him too. taylor tells steffie that she can't drag this out. every day she waits the closer hope gets to liam, so she has to tell him now that she is pregnant. she knows there is no connection more significant than the bond between a parent and their child. she was honest in italy and liam still chose hope. she won't open up to him again like that until she knows where this is going. dayzee calls maya and asks her to come down to the coffeehouse as she wants to
nick stands vigil at dante's penthouse wondering what is it he needs to know. dante tells him he has `` concerns. `` nick starts to call the doctor but felicia pulls him away saying bridget needs him. nick insists on knowing what happened that got her so upset. ridge surprises brooke with a little something he bought for her, but she doesn't buy it and tells him to get out. she's not in the mood for his romantic gesture. he tries to convince her it might be the answer to all their problems if he puts on some lingerie and she will even consider it. she throws him out but he won't give up. he bought almost every card in the place hoping for the right words on the card to win her heart back, so if that wasn't the right one, then maybe this is. taylor and dante discuss his situation with felicia and the possibility that dominick could be his son. he tells her he went over and told her everything and she is furious with him and still thinks nick is the father, but he wants to find out the truth with or without her help.
taylor tells nick that they are waiting ; he is engaged to ridge, he's made his decision so just tell nick it is over, it's over forever. she's surprised that taylor and nick are spending valentine's day together and that brooke wasn't that happy about it. nick assures her that he cares about brooke and always will, but he is happy right now with taylor, so he will think about putting forrester originals at jackie m's. rick and ridge continue to bicker as rick accuses his dad of wanting to sell the company and ridge is only trying to save it. he accuses ridge of being the only straight thinking one in this whole mess and putting the company at risk, no wonder his dad questions his loyalty. ridge reminds him that his loyalty to brooke is not in question. he left her and stephanie and r.j. and hope and taylor for taylor. he tore her heart out by leaving her alone with nick and she came crawling back. and now he has not only caused pain to one family, but to the entire family when he abandoned them, but taylor resorts to drinking when she doesn't know how to. he can not be responsible for everything that has come out of taylor's drinking. brooke barges in and says enough is enough! this is her house and she won't put up with the fighting. she is committed to ridge and nick has already moved on. she asks ridge to stop it and she 'd like to have a moment with her son. nick is the better man, so please do not let him slip away.
katie tells brooke that hope's wedding gown is ruined and she wonders what taylor wanted with it. brooke says it was a valentine's day gift from thorne and they found a way to celebrate. katie says she bet bill was happy too that liam and hope didn't get married. she doesn't think they were unreasonable to ask for an annulment, but she thinks steffy might have been a little unreasonable to think hope would go along with that. she hates to say it but she has to question the wisdom of hope and liam's press conference. hope wanted everyone who read the tabloid articles to know there would be a happy ending. but she had no motivation to make sure that did not happen. she will never be able to figure out what she wants if she is always emotionally on the run. she's not sure she can give hope that message, but brooke will. anything she says that remotely sounds like she is going to compromise her values will set off a red flag with hope and she will go to the source. she says she is living with bill again and they are working things out. but it is not about what they do or don't do, but self determination. it's about taking control of what you want in life. hope has been subjected to too many other people's agendas and she needs to realize that. rick drops in on ridge and asks if he wants her for a meeting. he says no, the rest of the meeting is not there yet. he tells her that overkill is his prerogue, but he will always support her. he begs her to please stay away from bill. one of them has to go and one of
amber hides the photo album from last christmas from clark and sally. she tells them she is giving it to ridge as a peace offering. she is hoping he will look at the pictures and realize what a wonderful day they had at christmas. clarke warns her if brooke sees the picture she will drop the bomb. stephanie tells brooke that ridge and bridget made it home and seem to be falling for each other. brooke lashes out at her for being the town crier and spreading gossip to all the world to hear. amber tries to get ridge to meet her in the middle and appreciate each other on christmas day, instead of trying to steal his son away from him. ridge throws her out and tells her she is no better than sheila. he tells her to take her little bribe, walk out that door and never show her face again.
steffy tells bill that he is a smart enough guy to know when he has been beaten at his own game. he knows what she wants and he is in the position to give it to her. she kisses him and says these lips are sealed ; katie will have no idea that they were in the bedroom so he needs to decide which is it going to be the company or his wife? she tells him to sell the company back to her and she will get what she always wanted  to save her dad and give him back forrester creations. taylor gives ridge a present and tells him that he should be running the company, but until that happens he has to find a way to cheer himself up and not be so depressed. he tells her that steffy has become irreplaceable. she's one of the only things keeping him chained to this place. he gives her a lot of credit for never letting go of her dream. it's a father's dream, but in some ways it has become a nightmare. he gets so wound up when he comes in this door that he feels like the walls are closing in. brooke, donna and katies discuss the meeting with ridge and eric and why they have to make everything so difficult. k atie tells them that she has an idea for an internal campaign and it is called `` goddess. `` brooke loves it and she is going to call steffie and have her get some press ideas right away. but she won't have time to work on it as she will be cleaning out her office. then she announces that she is firing her. they can't just throw her out ; she is ridge's daughter and she has a right to
ridge tells his dad that the caterers are paid and everything is cleaned up. now he has to go and deal with brooke who is not feeling well. he asks ivy if she has seen his dad. she says no, he is in the shower and off to bed now. quinn says she is thinking of doing just that. ridge won't stop her. she asks why he is still here when he should be home tending to brooke. bill catches brooke standing in front of an open refrigerator ; that is probably how she got sick in the first place. he says liam texted him that she was ill and had to miss the wedding so that is why he brought her a bill spencer pick - me - up. she appreciates the hunk of red meat but she does not have much of an appetite at the moment. bill says he is sorry she is sick but ridge had to go to the wedding all by himself. she tells him that ridge is going to be home soon as he called and asked to stay at eric's a little while longer. he wants to make sure everything is taken care of after the wedding. ridge tells quinn that he sees she did not waste any time getting her portrait back on the wall. she said she didn't mind sharing it with nicole on her special day but now that they are married she doesn't know why she is even explaining all of this to him. maybe it is because he can under her skin more than anyone else. he tells her not to flatter herself. he does not want her making goo - goo eyes at him like that again. he thought he was helping her at the wedding but it never should have happened and it will never happen again
liam tells hope that she sounds exactly like her mother. he loves her and he's scared for her but she can take care of herself. she says she does not need him to protect her. she can handle herself just fine without him. he says he is sorry about the kiss but thomas is still trying to drive a wedge between them. he is using his own son to do it and he is not okay with that. he will expose thomas one way or another. he despises him for good reason. he knew steffy was raising their daughter for months and then kept it from them. it was that kiss that she walked in on that tore them apart. he wishes he were wrong but there is too much evidence going the other way. is it possible that her love for douglas has given her permission to lie to herself about thomas? she says their precious family was shattered by liam's indecision and thomas had nothing to do with it. their little family is totally doable. they have the forrester family to support them. douglas will have his dad in check and he will have the father he deserves. it's that easy. she asks liam if she can talk to douglas alone. he tells her that he wants to come home to her and beth but not thomas. zoe thanks thomas for throwing her a birthday party and giving her a gorgeous pair of earrings. she thinks his life is amazing right now. there's a knock on the door and it is douglas. he wonders why the door is locked and why his daddy is in there. thomas says he thought he was with pam but douglas says he had fun. he wants thomas and his mommy
ridge tells rick to take it easy ; no one is knocking maya. rick says he will not be back in this house until his wife's portrait is back on the wall. eric says the party was only for a few clients and was done behind his back. maya tells bridget that she thought she was going to have to choose between being herself and being loved, but rick came in with an egg and a cup of coffee and that's where her whole life began. wyatt drops in on katie who is drinking scotch at the office. she says she is not tracking bill on her phone ; they share everything, to a fault. anyway, she knows where her dad is. he is at home with her sister. they are both having the same trouble. brooke is doing her magic act. she pines after some man and then she snaps her fingers and he is hers again. ridge introduces alice to caroline. alice says she has been so sad without stephanie, but here she is. ridge tells her good night and thanks her for hosting the party. bill tells brooke that he doesn't like feeling about his wife the way he did last night. it's like it is all or nothing. it never occurred to him that you could lose someone just by standing there looking at them.
taylor fills nick in on phoebe and rick. she thinks it is a little early for her to be getting involved with an older man. perhaps she should be in college. he doesn't have any advice, just hope they will make the right decision. ridge tells brooke that he is putting an end to this once and for all. rick has to go. he's been a divisive force in this house since he came back, and he is not staying here. he can pick up the rest of his things later, tonight he is going home. as long as phoe be is here, rick can not be. ridge sees the way he looks at her and the way she looks at him. this is why rick didn't want ridge to know they were together as he knew ridge would over - react. he has a right to be angry as he is. brooke assures him that nothing is going on here ; it's all in his head. nick tells taylor that from the sound of that phone call, it sounds like forrester's a little blue. she tells him that she hopes ridge is wrong, but she just hopes he is wrong. she knows rick is a class act and she wouldn't be concerned about him being involved with a younger girl. he plays poker with taylor and the first hand he loses, but the last time he played with hope, he lost his shirt.

sally asks wyatt if this is crazy. is this crazy to think that spectra fashions might literally rise from the ashes thanks to him. he says those are his terms if he wants to get back at spencer. bill will never get this one. he shows will and katie the new $ 100 bill. will points out that it used to be benjamin franklin's portrait on it but was discontinued in 1969 due to lack of use. bill says this is amazing. what kind of freak is will for not getting that right. will says he is glad bill is here. he is with his family ; where else would he want to be. liam tells hope that that was pam for the second time today. she is concerned that she is shirking her responsibilities at forrester. hope says she is sorry. he suggests they drive down to the beach and take a little walk and clear their heads but she says she has a better idea. there is someone that needs him more right now and he should go be with phoebe and kelly. he reminds her that he has been there every moment of every day since beth's death. she says it feels like she is keeping him from the girls. just go spend time with them and tell them how much he loves them and appreciates them as family. sally says she appreciates his support but she does not want him to jeopardize his relationship with bill or his future with spencer on her behalf. justin tells donna that this new and improved dollar bill is definitely bill spencer at his best. despite all that has gone wrong he thinks it would be great to get the spencer family back together. will has a chess club now and they

brooke tells rick that she is asking him to give up his relationship with phoebe for the sake of the family. it's causing too much tension in the house and she wants him to understand why ridge is reacting this way. rick doesn't understand why brooke is acting this way when just a few days ago she was thrilled that phoe be made him happy and now suddenly wants him not to spend any more time with her. brooke compares him to amber and reminds him that amber forced him to do things he wasn't ready to do. he argues that it isn't about ridge ; it is about brooke and her relationship with her daughter. maybe he shouldn't be asking her to leave ridge for a man who has hurt her too many times. she begs him to please do this for her, do it for the children. the children need their father ; they need him, so he has to end it with philoebe. he can't ; he just wants to be alone. ridge tries to talk some sense into his daughter about her feelings for rick. he's sorry he didn't stop it before, but it has to stop now. he tells her that if she is going to see rick, he wouldn't. his mother is with him right now and she will be telling him the same thing he just told him, and he will listen to her. ridge reminds her again that brooke supported her friendship with rick from the beginning, but rick crossed the line when he kissed her. he hates to tell her this and it will never happen again, but she is not mature enough to understand. she won't let him come between them like this. she tells him that
steffy invites rick in for a drink. she tells him that things didn't work out over at her mom's, but she is better off here. it's much less awkward when guys want to spend the night. liam tells his dad that he loves steffy, but no more pressure, no more lying. he is with hope now. he knows bill still loves him, but he can't shut up about these two women in his life. bill says he made a mistake, but it is time to move on. they don't have a lot of experience, but maybe they can help each other get past this. hope tells brooke that she made a decision that she is proud of and she doesn't want anyone to convince her otherwise. she said she would wait until marriage and that is her decision and she is sticking to it. bill tells liam that he will keep saying it until he believes it. they are two different people ; one is interested and ready to go while the other is not. bill knows whose door he would be knocking on tonight, and it would be hope. without even being tempted by his wife who is keeping her bed warm for him. he calls liam a liar. he can not lie to him ; he is not a corpse. he has hot blood coursing through his veins. he's had fantasies. hell he even had a little one with brooke, his wife's sister. hope will not live up to his expectations once he gets her into his bed.
ridge fills taylor in on phoebe's crush on rick and that it is over. she is angry at him and disappointed in him. she thought she was in love with him. brooke is still able to work with rick, so ridge thinks they should give her a little extra tlc for the next while and just keep an eye on things. taylor doesn't understand why rick broke up with phoe be when he just said that to shut his mother up. ridge says she will get over it ; they will help her. she's not a little girl anymore and is experiencing her first time of real heartbreak. eric and stephanie look over the location of their new rodeo drive stores and she reminds him this was his idea, so he needs to be confident and not start second guessing himself. the press and public will be all over them and he must appear confident and determined, or this whole thing will come crashing down on top of them. he laments it would be nice to have a safety net in case this didn't succeed. she asks if this whole concept of selling and owning their own retail stores was eric's idea, then what the hell is he doing here? brooke stops by nick's and he asks if she is lost. he understands she may be moving in down the street and they might be neighbors. she says yes, she was just on her way down there. he quips it is a very expensive street and he guesses she must have caught the loan officer in an optimistic mood. she opines that forrester originals is a sure bet ; he should have opened up their own stores a long time ago. that way he won't have been able to torpedo

rick tells ridge that this is the changing of the guard. he has been the big man around here since he hit puberty, but not anymore. his beautiful, sophisticated, smart little girl steffy has fallen for him. she worships him. he may not have his rugged cheekbones or his award winning smile, but he's got it where it counts. brooke and stephanie dine at the forrester bridal shower, but it might be hard for her to drag her away from her big night at jackie m's. donna tells katie and donna that nick is just trying to save his company and it's not going to work. his honey bear is not threatened in the least by that old sow's sour grapes. rick rants and raves that ridge has been a big man since he was a little boy, but now he is going to be saying his vows in his little destiny - westiny spot on the beach and he will be looking at ridge and seeing his pain as he says good - bye to another daughter. he will have a front row seat on holidays, birthdays, valentine's day, they will be making little ridgies. he can see the steam coming out of his ears. ridge wants to punch him, but rick says go ahead. hit him if you want to, but hit him chicken. what's the matter with him? he better not be getting green in the gills. he needs all the strength he can get to walk his little daughter down the aisle. and then they can go off to the honeymoon and it will be one big happy family.

steffy lands on her knee and tells liam and dr. meade that it will hurt for a while, but she will live. she assures liam that he can go. she knows hope is probably wondering where he is. he says he will call her and let her know. she tells him to go, she is not that person anymore. she could take advantage of him and whine about her knee to make him feel guilty about leaving her. but she doesn't want to be that person any more. he tells her if she wants company, go ahead and check in with him. taylor and stephanie drop in on brooke and brooke assures them that no one was hurt in the accident. steffy tells ramona that liam found her on the mountain and while they were waiting for the ski patrol, he held her in his arms and insisted on staying at the hospital with her. he 'd still be there if she had not sent him back to hope. ramona tells her that hope's problems with the press are her own making and she isn't sicing them on hope. hope rushes back to the cabin and calls liam. she apologizes to him for losing him on the slopes and then thinking he was right behind her, but he wasn't. she thought they could meet at the bottom of the mountain. he admits that he was getting so worried about her. she's obviously milking this for drama. a doctor tells him that steffie can't walk so he's not worried about it.
ridge fills stephanie in on what happened at big bear. she is livid that he slept with brooke and accuses him of being like caroline. he reassures her that brooke loves him and they will work all of this out. nick tells brooke that he will do whatever it takes to make sure this never happens to her again. he wants justice for what ridge did to her. brooke asks him that he trust her. bridget visits brooke at home and tells her about taylor's accusations. she also tells her that nick found out, but she forgave him. the board meeting is in recess when massimo receives a letter from megan confessing to her crimes. nick announces the meeting is over and orders massimo to resign. ridge walks into his father's office just as nick is throwing massimo out. ridge warns nick that this isn't over, and the battle is just beginning.
thomas coughs and grunts and looks for brooke. ridge and waisea work their way closer to the island and ridge tells thomas that he knows they are on that island. eric tells stephanie that he hates to say it, but he thinks it is time for them to prepare for the worst. they lost phoebe and they can't lose a second grandchild. dayzee cries that she wishes there was something she could do to help those two, but pam tells her they will have to work this out on their own. hope tells them there is nothing to work through ; her mom and thomas are coming home. thomas looks for water and finally finds some on the beach. he gulps it down and tries to get brooke to open her eyes. she tells him that maybe she does deserve to die. he tells her not to say that ; they are going to be fine. they find a message on the sand  help. nick tells them that ridge is on his way now.
bridget worries about her mother's reaction when she finds out that ridge dug up taylor's grave. stephanie tries to explain to brooke that ridge needs help, and that she needs to face up to what is really going on with him. brooke doesn't want to believe her, and she tells steph that she will wait for ridge to get home to explain everything. steph thinks that ridge is still desperately in love with taylor. ridge tells taylor that he loved her, but the kids wanted brooke to be their mother, and he couldn't. he had nothing left. he tells her that he never stopped loving her. nick and bridget decide on a small wedding with no witnesses.
donna wanders around the forrester mansion and remarks that it is so beautiful. her mother probably has other issues with daughter number two marrying her former prince charming. brooke tells donna that she is the lady of the house now and she will come to her mother if she needs anything to be moved or changed. donna just wishes her mother were here. eric invites stephen in and says he was just looking for a place to get out of the way. there is no rule against the father of the bride seeing the groom, but poisoning the groom is frowned upon. stephen says he thinks there has been enough of that between them, but he sees where that has led now. he tells eric that donna will most likely outlive him, so eric had better make her happy as his bratty children and money won't. he warns eric not to insult his family. they are going to be here today, don't insult them. and some of them just weren't meant to be fathers. when he ended his last marriage, women old enough to be his daughter were still in grammar school. ridge finds stephanie hiding out in the guest house. she tells him she saw eric last night and yesterday and he didn't look like he was going to go through with the wedding. pam is grousing that she doesn't even want to be there tomorrow if donna marries eric. she wants to hold that empty little head of donna's over there and hold her head underwater. she's fiddling while rome burns. she can't believe eric is going through with this today. she begs her not to do any more dirty tricks. some relationships change,
liam tells steffy that he wants to be in on it, all of it, the nursery, everything. she says she is working hard to make it fun for him and it's working. thomas tells oliver that someone didn't get the memo ; they are going surfing today. oliver says he got hope to come over as they need to do something to get her mind off liam. hope asks thomas when did he get a motorcycle. he says he is holding on to it. he just hopes he doesn't regret moving in with this guy. bill tells alison that something is going on with brooke. he was at forrester yesterday and he walked in on her and donna and she wasn't herself. she was trying to hide it, but why would she do that to him of all people. she is pregnant and it is bill's child and he is the father. donna tells brooke that she can not hide from this. at least not for long. what is she going to do? she is worried for katie and the rest of their family. hope tells thomas that he does not have to babysit her right now, but she is fine. liam says his dad is not going to be making any more babies any time soon. he is all about family now, just like him. eric comes into the office and sees donna looking for rick. he tells her that he is sorry that he interrupted but he is not surprised that she is upset. she tells him that it is not menopause.
stephanie and eric sit by ridge's bedside and wonder why he isn't waking up. christian tells them he spoke to dr. plotnikov and he has some concerns. stephanie thinks he just doesn't want to wake up because the one person in the world he wants to be with is not there. brooke and nick wake up in each other's arms after a night of partying in mexico. nick wants her to call home to check on things, but she says she has left a message for brooke. eric tells them they have to leave her a message as she left the company and she does not know what has happened to ridge. hector, thomas and taylor arrive at the hospital and hector tells taylor that the fight was about brooke, of course. stephen arrives at jackie's and he and jackie invites him to sit down and have a cup of coffee with her. taylor calls eric and tells him that ridge is asking for brookes and he needs her.
hope questions steffy why she is so certain all of a sudden that liam is going to come back to her. she knows she is avoiding the question, but does that mean that she doesn't have an answer? she tells hope that she is a confident person and it is not what liam said, but rather what he did in aspen. she has owned up to her mistakes and she is not going to make them again. liam rants to bill that this is the time to break it off with hope ; she has already moved back home. if he really wanted to marry her he would not have ripped up the annulment papers and certainly not have kissed her on a silver platter. bill tells him don't make up some sappy reason when he knows the truth. he does not want to turn his back on his wife, on his marriage. hope has moved back in so now is the perfect time to do that. this is his time to call steffydy and get her over here, talk to her about aspen, tell her about the kiss, get her back in his bed and tell her to come home tonight. katie and caroline join in and bill tells liam that the food is ready so just say the word and they will all leave. ridge and brooke wonder what all the commotion is going on and hope tells them that things are going well enough until ridge brings up hope's wedding. ridge's refusal to design a gown for her. ridge says that would not be fair to steffie. brooke says she knows steffly is hurt, but she is getting over it so it's okay to be happy for hope. hope says she hates the idea
jackie plucked nick's hair as part of her re - running the paternity test. deacon showed up to show her. caitlin's friend jimmy brought her a birthday gift, but she preferred to just forget the day was her mother's birthday and move on. hector assured samantha that nothing bad would happen, and that it would be a great day for their daughter. samantha was worried about the reaction of her daughter to her new family, but hector was confident she 'd handle it all right. jackie told nick that dominick wanted him to name his son dominick, jr. jackie confided in nick that she felt guilty about taking on the family name. she told him that she was only doing what was best for him. deke called and told jackie to get her butt over to the hospital to pick up brooke's medical records. when she got there, she found out brooke had been switched to a new doctor  dr. sobel. she was relieved when deacon said he 'd be able to get to work.
wyatt tells liam they have what they need now  a bombshell so huge. liam says oh my god, tell him already  what is it that rick is going to pay for? wyatt says he took a gamble but he confessed to maya that he had overheard her and her sister talking the other day. he knew she was hiding something huge and he thought it was rick at first but then he realized it was nicole. brooke tells ridge this is a delicate matter and she was very firm that maya had to tell rick about her past before he proposes. ridge says he should just let rick get what is coming to him. and he probably would if he weren't so important to brooke. she says no matter what he has done to him, he was supposed to be ceo after his father. he reminds her that stephanie always told him that being ceo was his birthright. he doesn't want her to get the wrong impression. he is not going after maya because she is transgender. she has made that decision for herself. but a couple of kisses with caroline almost sent rick off the deep end. he sees what he wants to see  ricky is finally going to get his comeuppance. maya tells nick that she does not know what she would do if she lost rick. nick says there is no reason she shouldn't, especially if he is as loving and understanding as she says. she will make him understand as long as he hears it from her and no one else. nicole tells carter that she did something and it felt right at the time but now she is wondering. carter says one ride on the spencer jet
ridge tells the group to stop with the pictures ; brooke needs to get some air. she apologizes and says she is sorry, but she needs to be alone. thomas offers to help, but brooke won't let him. she wants to call jarrett and come up with some kind of an explanation. ridge tells her to forget jarrett, forget the reporters, forget all that and just focus on herself and getting better. she doesn't want to disappoint him. he tells her that she hasn't disappointed him, and he's the one who let her come back to work so soon. taylor tells ridge that she would like to talk to brooke about this. the longer she keeps this bottled up, the worse it could get. ridge says he 'll leave the two of them alone for a little bit. just tell brooke what she saw and feel. she 'd be surprised how much brooke would feel if she opened up a little ; it would do her a world of good. tawny gets a text from hope and tells liam to give it up, lover boy. it's not him, she's too self - centered to share him with a real nincompoop who is having a baby with another woman. she tells him to stop texting back. hope has moved on with oliver and liam should just be with her and the baby. oliver tells hope there has been no word from liam. he is not bashing the guy, but he knows he is doing a great thing by breaking up with amber and taking responsibility and being with thomas. but it means that amber will always take precedence over him and they will be second to amber and that kid. think about that the next
bill returns home and gives liam a welcome back gift. he says he is leaving town in a few days so he wants to make sure he will have time to read it before he leaves. he tells liam that he is going as far away from l.a. as he can get. brooke asks hope about her personal life. hope says she is still dating both wyatt and liam but she needs this time. she needs to make the right decision before she moves on with her life. she can see herself with either one of them but she has to be careful. she doesn't want to send them mixed signals. hope tells brooke that she is so lucky. she is dating both men but she can tell they are both ready to move on and start a life with her. she just needs to take her time and then when she makes her decision she will be glad she took that time to pick the right man. liam tells bill that he just got his job back and is back with brooke so why would he want to leave town right now. bill says he won't be gone that long and he has brooke as his vp so he can trust his own son. as far as brooke is concerned she is motivating him to go out of town without her. and he is taking her to dubai. she knows nothing about it but he will keep his mouth shut if liam will let him keep a secret. bill tells him this is just his way of showing brooke what she means to him. he promised her the world and he's going to give it to her. quinn finds hope's new kitten and says she will make sure liam gets custody of it when hope picks him. w
katie and donna drop in on brooke and say they have been worried about her. she says she is doing the best she can. it's a lot to handle and she is not sure she will ever get over it. she knows she moved back in with bill recently, but how is it living with him again? thomas tells dayzee that he had a great time with her last night. he's lucky to have his dad. but as special as it was, he doesn't have to worry about him. they need to focus on spending more time together. he tells her to check her schedule as he heard that dayzee's had a little revamp since he has been gone. bill tells justin that he is thinking about steffy. he can't get her out of his mind. dayzee tells anthony that she had an amazing date last night with mr. thomas forrester. she has never met anyone like him and she can not wait for her to get to know him better. anthony tells her that she deserves someone real special in her life. thomas asks dayzee if she was listening in on his phone conversation. she swears she wasn't, but the look on his face says otherwise. he wants to know why she is here. she asks if he is ever going to open up to her about what happened. he says he is a married man and she does own a lot of fc stock so she needs to be careful. she gives him a quick hug before she leaves.
zende is shocked that sasha is pregnant. she says it is amazing how nicole keeps coming through for her. she was actually kind of afraid to tell him, but then she heard how in awe he was at nicole's birth, so she figured he would want to know. he wants to know how long she has known ; she says just since last night. she tried to tell zende earlier at the pool, but he said he had to go to the office and that wasn't true. he says he is sorry, it is not right to lie even if you are trying to protect someone's feelings. sasha says she understands. viv and nicole show maya and rick how to hold a baby. julius walks in and says he knows he is persona non grata and no one wants to see or talk to him even if he is alive. maya says she sent him the text and that is it, he is a grandfather. nicole says she is tired but she is real good. zende tells sasha that he is not ready to be a father. she can not believe he would ask her to think about that when she had not even talked to him about it. and now he is going to kick her to the curb just like he did nicole. brooke barges into bill's house at this hour and scolds him for being a workaholic and never home at this time of night. he tells her he is getting dressed and she should have thought of this before coming over in the first place. they just know right from wrong. katie comes home and brooke tells him to tell her there is something for her in the closet. bill says that is not a
brooke tells eric that she can't believe she is really doing this. she can have another child and a big house full of children and grandchildren again. she knows he misses that. he says he doesn't want to relive his younger days, but he remembers them. she says it won't be that way this time. she begs him not to say that if he cares at all about her. if he loves her at all, she can not have this child without him. it will ruin katie's marriage and her relationship with rick and bridget. he is the only thing standing between her and a disaster. dr. meade tells taylor and thomas that she thinks it is best that steffy stay another day or two in the hospital. taylor says of course her heart is breaking for her, but she thinks this is just grief and she thinks home with her husband is the best place for her. liam tries to comfort steffie and tells her that it is okay for her to remember. she cries that she was selfish and she was just trying to get home the best way she could. he tells her to let it out ; just let it all out. she laments that he told her no more motorcycle riding until after the baby is born. he gets her dressed and gives her some maternity pants to put on. he has other ones too, but they don't work. she tells him they will not work. he's not to encourage her to get another one or even to have one repaired.
brooke begs ridge to give her ring back. he begs her to come on. she deserves better and he can't let her go. she says he can be so frustrating. he says he is doing his job as a father and the man who will always love her. he knows they can not be a couple anymore but they are never going to stop caring for each other. she reminds him that he is now engaged to katie and she is engaged to bill so there is nothing he can say to change that. there is no woman lurking around the corner, no taylor or caroline, no private poetry readings with her sister. it's all about her now. she begs him to give the ring back, but he says no he can not. she can not marry bill spencer. he is beneath her. she cries that the great ridge forrester is unavailable so she will have to settle for someone who really means it when they say they love her and that is bill. ridge says he will help her find someone else. he will be her dating service. she scoffs that is great. he can now make sure she is on the right path in life and it will be good for her and rj. he only wants what is best for her, but that is not bill. she rushes out and tells him to wait ; she catches him before he leaves. wyatt tells hope that his mom is going to be okay with the engagement. she's not sure she knows how to be interested in someone, but if she were it would be his dad. she hates him and never wanted him to meet him. he'says she is complicated.
katie urges donna to take a breath ; they have to be smart about this. donna says if it is true, she wants to know him too. katie suggests she go to the office and get some information from there ; eric has a big meeting. ridge and thorne don't want to wait, but eric won't let them. eric reminds them again that donna is his wife and she has a place here. they will respect her. ridge doesn't see donna having a place in this company, and especially not with the negative publicity she has brought to the company. felicia and brooke add their two cents and say donna has no place here, just donna. ridge interrupts and says his dad has asked them all to respect donna, the least he can do is be straight with her. he rants at ridge, thorne and felicia that this is not a vendetta, it's strictly business. no more secrets, no more lies and no more of this garbage from all of them. he orders them to treat donna in a civil manner. whatever example they set, everyone else will follow. this meeting is adjourned. marcus shows up at forrester's and demands to see mrs. logan. she is glad to see him and apologizes for not knowing how to get in touch with him. she has some things to talk to him about, but they can't be there at eric's so he has to meet her at her office.
taylor drops in on hope and wants her to promise her that she will give liam and steffy all the space they need and not to take advantage of liam's grief. she tells hope that she is glad she understands, but hope could get hurt again if she thinks it is okay for her to pursue liam again. they are moving on with their lives and planning to get pregnant again, so it would be in hope's best interest to keep her distance. hope doesn't understand why that surprises taylor. she married her because she was pregnant and now it sounds like she is trying to get him to stay by doing the same thing. taylor assures her that is not the way it is, although she can understand why hope might feel that way. hope will leave liam to move on with his wife and that is where he belongs. brooke confides in donna that she knows this sounds impulsive, but she needs to put a name to the father of the baby as katie will be suspicious and she is not going to take a wrecking ball to her sister's life. she can make this work. she has been married to eric before and they have children together. donna is skeptical that this is going to fly. she wonders how she will deal with taylor if she demands a paternity test? brooke says she will get one somehow, and she will tell bill too. when he sees her building a life with eric, planning for their child, he will let it go. she does not want to hurt their sister. she wants her happy and to spend the rest of her life with her child and her husband and she's going to do everything possible to make sure that happens.
bill tells brooke that he will not stop her but he is not going to tell her where they are getting married. dollar bill has the hookup in dubai so they are going to go there first. she says he is always keeping her on her toes. he tells her not to keep him waiting as they have a date in abu dhabi and dubai. ridge tells katie that he can't believe he let bill get to him like that but he does. the thought of him marrying brooke and being a stepfather to rj is just not acceptable to him. liam catches hope in a down mood and says maybe this will help. he fills her in that bill is taking brooke out of the country and they are leaving for the middle east today. wyatt calls bill and says it means a lot to him and his mom and that is why he is calling. she is having a hard time with bill's engagement and she doesn't think he should know but perhaps he can talk to her. bill says he can not do that. he is going out of town, in fact all the country, with brooke to get married. brooke goes to ridge's but finds he isn't there. instead she runs into k atie and tells her that bill and she are leaving town and when they get back they will be married. she does not want to argue with her but she just wants ridge and r.j. to know where she is going to be. she just wanted to tell them before she left town. ridge has a problem with that too. she explains that she is moving on with her life just the way he did with her. she can not lie about that. time will help them heal.
thomas wakes up with sally in his arms. she thanks him for not giving up on her little band of misfits. she just wishes he did not have to be at odds with his family. he reminds her that her brother is in bed with the enemy. steffy tells ridge that thomas risked everything for sally so that means he really cares for her. he crossed the line so what does she want him to do? he says they have help. zende is learning the ropes. she says they can not do this without thomas. he should not have fired him. he is his son so he can not let that destroy their relationship. he says he had it with thomas, but maybe he went too far. she tells him they need to come together as a family and she is calling a meeting. the doctor tells nicole that zende does not know they are there and she hopes they will have some good news. viv tells her that whatever happens she and zende will get through this. charlie wakes up on darlita and shirley's side of the bed. saul does not care if thomas is tall or handsome or lifts weights but he is not that great. he just wants to use his money to move in on sally. sally tells thomas that she really likes him so much that she is going to call in sick to work but he says she doesn't have to. he would love to lay around with miss go - getter all day but he knows she wants to get the business up and running but he won't let her do that. he does not like to fight with his own father and he certainly does not want to get fired by his own dad. ste
stephanie tells pam that she tried calling her and she knows they have to cancel their dinner plans. pam says she knows, but stephanie is the queen of the ball and tonight she is going to take back her throne. she advises her to pack a little bag just in case. there is no doubt in her mind that she will not be staying the night, and she won't be here when she wakes up in the morning. she's too old for regrets, just like she is for a man, so she tells her to get ready for her shindig and don't dare tell her that she is not going to be late. eric tells the family that they have had many family celebrations at the forrester's over the years, but tonight might be the biggest celebration of all. stephen tells brooke that his mother would be alive today if it weren't for steph. now it is up to him to protect his three beautiful daughters from steph and her lunatic sister. thorne tells his dad that he can not throw a party like this and not tell them what it is all about. ridge tells steffy that he knows what he would like it to be  his mother and dad back together just like they used to be. thomas surprises his dad by ordering a special meal at the outdoor restaurant. he's almost like a kid getting ready for a prom.
ridge hands thomas his ticket and tells him to go to shanghai. he needs experience if he is going to take over the company. ridge says rick will still be here but not under the same roof. thomas says he can get experience here. ridge reminds him that he and caroline are family and he does not want douglas to get caught up in the scandal so he needs to leave la. sasha is shocked that nicole and maya want her to take a pregnancy test to prove to them that she and zende are having a baby. she says she does not have to prove anything to them but she does want to be sure. nicole calls zende and asks him to come to forrester so he can be there when they get the results. he says he is on his way. he doesn't think she is lying but if she is he is about to find out. eric wishes him luck. maya says good as zende will be there to see for himself whether or not it is true or not. viv and eric tell zende that he will have to fight her for first dibs on lizzy when she wakes up. brooke asks what changed his mind. he tells them it was being in the hospital with nicole who just gave birth to her sister. it really opened his eyes and now he can not turn away from a woman so generous and loving. rick walks in and says nicole never wanted the relationship to end in the first place and now there is no longer a baby between them. zende says well unless there is one. he has sasha's pregnancy test. she tells maya and nicole that she is not calling her a liar, but she is
nick, jackie and taylor are stunned by the verdict and nick insists that they take care of each other  sleeping, eating and pregnant. brooke berates ridge for not telling the police and lt. baker. stephanie wants to get an attorney, but brooke won't let her. ridge walks in and tells them that nick is not going to spend one more night in jail. he fills them in on why he went to paris and how he dumped shane's body in the santa monica bay and he allowed nick to be accused of doing that, hoping he would be accused too and go to jail. phoebe wants to blame her dad, but he assures her that is all going to stop now.
brooke tells rick that phoebe was very generous, but it cost her so she doesn't want to rub her face in what he is doing. she reminds him that he can not get married to anyone else. dating his girlfriend's mother is serious, divorce is serious and so is drinking when you are nursing a baby. ridge reminds her that this was not a romance, but a rescue mission and now he and taylor are trying to convince her that there is more to it than that. rick tells brooke that he is in love with taylor, so what does it matter how it all began. phoe be's feelings only mattered and rick's didn't. taylor tells them to shut up ; she is not having any more of this. she was just proposed to, so it's not as if either of them have a say in this. when he first asked her to marry him, she couldn't give him a yes or a no. now he's given her a ring and she accepts it. she just wants him to be patient and give her time to talk to steffy and thomas so they can get used to the idea. she does not want to lose brooke, but she is beginning to see how easily that can happen. pam confronts marcus about his being taken advantage of by donna logan. she thinks he is just a wannabe actor waiting for his big break. passing cheese puffs in high society, but little did he know the lady of the house was going to be all hands. she accuses him of having an affair with donna. he tells her she is so off base. he 'll take a lie detector test if she wants one
at midnight, steffy tells liam that there is still time if he still wants her to be his wife. hope tells brooke that she is sorry, but she feels like cinderella waiting for midnight. she's sure it is not easy saying good - bye to a marriage, but liam said it a long time ago. brooke asks if she wants to go over there. hope says no, she thinks he wants to be alone tonight. she doesn't want to interfere in any closure that he might need. she asks brooke if her dress is ready? she says not yet, but eric is still making alterations. she tells her that she has an idea ; she 'd like her to look at it. it might be bad luck, but there is something she wants liam to see. at the cliff house, ridge and stephanie wait for liam and hope to call and let them know. taylor tells bill that she feels sorry for him. she would not want to be in his shoes. she knows it is going to be very difficult with both of his daughters at odds and one of them will get hurt. bill calls taylor and says he's sorry to call so late. she says it's okay. she is with ridge and brooke and they are waiting for steffie to call. this is liam's last chance. she hopes he makes the right decision. he says he does too.

hope tells wyatt that liam can't move on with her until he figures out why steffy left so he is trying to make things right now in paris. he's not a jerk, and she thinks if she meets him she might like him. he doesn't think so. if he can bail on a woman like her then there must be something wrong with him. she wants to know more about him like where he got that necklace. he says it is a family thing. it's one of his mother's first pieces. she's a jewelry designer. he found it in their vault and she said it was his. they don't have many stores right now but they are developing an international clientele and he works with her. he helps her run the business. she says maybe he should hit up bill spencer for ad space. he wears liam's dad's sword design all the time. but when he found the necklace, it was the only one his mother ever made and it looks identical. karen tells katie that she has a really bright future with men like her brother, bill. she will let her and brooke talk to him. justin tells bill that he could have asked for a lot more than only 1 % of the company in the divorce. bill says she is not getting any of that. they are not splitting up. he will not let her break up this family. brooke is talking to her right now. he tells justin that as his friend he has to tell him that is a very bad idea. he is in a meeting with counsel and he is assuming she hasn't signed the papers yet. he should not put anything over on his wife
taylor tells ridge that it seems so damn unfair that nick and brooke are the only ones who ended up with happiness, and it's all because of him. no one deserves to be happy more than she does. she's done her grieving and has moved on, so he shouldn't beat himself up. he only wants her to find the best in life, a man who won't let her down the way he did. he wishes he hadn't been so focused on getting logan back and not taylor and the kids and he probably wouldn't have lost so much with her and the girls. taylor tries to get him to give her a big hug for her birthday, but he brushes her off. stephanie realizes that phoebe is worried about her mother and father, and she tries to talk some sense into her. ridge assures her that brooke has made her choice and they all have to live with that. he doesn't think fighting over the company again is going to help anyone. and after what he has done to taylor now, there is no way he can ever judge her again. phoe be calls taylor from the car and tells her that she thinks she missed the turn off for uncle thorne's party and the fog is so bad that she can't see where she is going. she makes a u - turn and then calls back and tells taylor that she is fine and will call her when she gets to the party.
stephanie tells brooke that she got everything she wanted  ridge and his family  and that she 'll be waiting a long time to take care of taylor's babies. ridge tells stephanie to go back to the party while he and thorne take brooke home. thorne tells ridge that he wishes he had gotten involved sooner, before things got out of hand. he tells ridge he could have made her feel more welcome or find some middle ground  with him there is no middle ground. brooke continues to tell the baby that all the noise is a good thing  it means that he is going to grow up in a really nice family. hector tries to talk to ridge about caitlin's age and hector's views on her coming to work for forrester's. ridge assures him that she will be taken care of like a diamond  they will be there for her. nick arrives with his date, catherine, and brooke is glad to see him. he gives her the ring and she accepts.

taylor calls stephanie to let her know that brooke is here at forrester's. she makes it sound as though it is temporary, but she's even bounced back even faster when she came sniffing around. taylor assures her that she is not paranoid, so don't worry about it. brooke may not work here right now, but that doesn't mean she is gone. nick and pam show up for the interview for the pr position and are introduced as mr. and mrs. marone. clarke is surprised to hear that pam is the receptionist and wonders if they are going to fire him. she quips that would be madness as she wields ultimate power and no one gets in without her saying so and nobody comes out without her giving them a chance to hear her out. both nick and jackie are taken aback when they hear the name, whip jones. they wonder if this is a trick door. he tells them that he is just here for a job. he didn't stay in l.a. for very long. he's bored to tears when he saw jackie's face on a magazine cover. and he 'd like to make half as much as they are paying garrison. ridge is with brooke when taylor tells thomas and steffy that she does not want them thinking what she thinks they are thinking ; brooke will not be a problem for this family. ridge walks in and brooke tells him this is more like home than home because he is here. she was hurt, she was shocked and she was wrong, but it's not too late to fix it.
ridge laments to taylor that he can't believe their son is married. the lawyer is going to begin drafting the annulment papers right away. nick plays with hope and tells her that's the end of the book, but there's more. he tells her to get settled in and he 'll come back tomorrow and tell her all about it. brooke tells hope that nick has to go see bridget. bridget refuses dante's offer to run away with him. she tells him that she loves nick and he is in love with her mother. dante tries to convince her that she is much more intelligent than this, looking at ridge, deacon and now nick. she accuses him of trying to stop her from getting involved in this. she knows that nick loves her and sees it every time he looks at her.
nicole tells zende that he has made her so full. she feels like she lack for nothing when she is with him. he says that doesn't sound corny and she is right. she is the most beautiful woman he has ever met and he is grateful that she took him back. she tells him that she was a surrogate for maya as she could not have children of her own. it was something she had to do as rick and maya wanted a family and she gave maya one. he is not sure he deserves it, but boy is he grateful. he tells her that he wants that future with her, the one he almost lost. she admits that she wants that too. brooke tells ridge that forgiveness is his greatest virtue and it has gotten them through a lot of hard times. she says she is so proud of him for the way he has handled douglas. ridge says it took him a little while to figure it out but he is glad he did. he has not seen that much grit in her in a long time. she laments that she has messed up and she has to fix things with katie. she will do everything she can to get that family back together. thomas tells caroline that he is going to be living in the loft that used to be ridge and brooke's. he will have to get the place babyproofed and settled but it will be so much fun to have them over. they will get to spend time alone with douglas and be a little family. he wants to spoil the boy but caroline says no, they will not spoil him. there is a knock at the door and it turns out to be veronica. she has a little nephew about douglas '
thorne tells rick and amber about deacon's sudden interest in becoming a father. amber doesn't like the sound of it. brooke tells thorne and rick that macy is behind it. macy tells deacon that she set brooke straight  she had a right to see his son, and as his friend she had the right to spend time with him too. the kids are having a great time on the beach, until bridget gets caught in the middle. thomas, phoebe, and steffy beg her to come back to live with them again, but she says she can't. bridget tells them she thinks her mom will be a good mom, and that she's going to work hard to be. stephanie overhears the conversation and confronts her about her thinking bridget was thinking the same thing. she accuses her of getting her own way and making her own happiness more important than ridge's. they argue back and forth about whether brooke should be with ridge or not, but brooke declares that she and ridge love each other and there's nothing steph can do about it  they will get married next year or the year after, and steph won't do anything about it.
clark calls darla and asks her to rip up the ingénue designs and bring them to him. he says it's life or death for sally. she doesn't understand what he is asking her to do. clarke says it will be a win / win for both sally and for forrester's, but it will hurt the two people she loves most  herself and thorne. she agrees to do it. thorne is upset with himself for not going along with clarke's request. he calls megan to ask her to make copies of the proofs for each of the department heads. sally invites stephanie to her place for a birthday party, but they end up arguing about her inebriated behavior at brooke's wedding. hector and samantha talk about her adjustment to living with teenagers. she says it has been incredible being part of his family. they talk about caitlin's showing at the showing today, and hector is concerned that she's too young for a job that is so serious for a girl her age. she assures him that she is having the time of her life. rick talks about his time with amber and how he fell in love with her. she got pregnant and then lied to him about the baby, but he didn't know about it at the time. he married her and then they had a baby together. he tells her that he wouldn't want the same thing to happen to her. they play a game of pool on the living room couch and end up on the couch together, then kiss.
darla tells aly to make her pay for what her mother did to her. put an end to this. liam tells wyatt that this is a mental health emergency and they all need to get in touch with aly's therapist. ivy says she thinks it is just a way of dealing with whatever she is feeling. rick tells maya that she inspires him. she is the woman he has been looking for and he wants to marry her. nicole tells zende that she always thought a fashion show was boring unless you were the model. maya and rick come back in and nicole says they missed the standing ovation. they ask if her parents are there. she says no and ridge and caroline are not there either. zende tells nicole that he has not seen steffy either. he says she will be there with a case of tequila and a mariachi band before you know it. aly tries to drive but darla tells her to get out of the car as she is trying to kill her. wyat says aly is disappointed in a lot of people but not in them in particular. he doesn't know what it is that she has against maya, steffie and the other forrester's. ivie tells rick that she knows where aly goes when she wants to be alone. she goes to her dad's old office in the basement. she also goes to the beach to the house she grew up in and that is pretty close to where her mom had her accident.
brooke tells rick and bridget she needs a job to prove she is a fit mother and can take care of her children. she realizes she trusted both of them all these years, but now she can trust only nick. she hopes he didn't tell taylor about last night. she needs something from him, and she wants it now. eric tells stephanie and felicia that the construction costs for the new stores are double what they thought they would be. and now they have to buy brooke out. and who is going to replace her name in the industry? they don't need her baggage and problems. they agree she will always have a special place in her heart bologna, but she will land on her feet and they will feel it. he was married to brooke and he can tell you it's better to have her as a friend than an enemy. nick tells brooke he is sorry for her raw deal at the hearing, but he's going to head over to the boat and cool off before they say something they both will regret. brooke tells nick last night changed things. she is now sounding like the woman he fell in love with, and he has to say no just because he is a doctor. taylor tells bridget that she knows her mom isn't happy with her, but maybe it was the wakeup call her mom needed.
brooke tells ridge that just when she thought she couldn't love him anymore, just when it looked like she would, she found out she did love him again. he was miraculous in how he handled steffy. and now she is going to announce his wife's return to forrester creations. he's very proud of how she is making amends. brooke isn't so sure hope won't lose her mind if she finds out what happened between her and oliver. hope tells oliver that it is amazing to think she was supposed to be getting on a plane this morning. she knows her dad must have talked to her, but it would be something if she really had changed. steffie tells stephanie that she 'd love to tell her what she has on brooke, but not right now. when the time comes, she will find out. liam tells justin that he 'd like to get his old laptop back to fc, but he doesn't want to leave it in justin's hands. he just wants to delete all the files and send it back for recycling. justin says it's just a lucky coincidence. he tells liam that brooke logan is a very interesting lady and he thinks he would like to know her better if he knew more about her. she is beautiful, conniving and very loyal to her family. he admires her and thinks she would work well here. but how do they get the company back? they have to shake up the family by dropping a bomb and they have one that is about to explode. he calls jarrett and tells him to get down to the press conference and take liam. it will be his first big lesson in
taylor tells steffy that she needs to have some compassion for katie. she will be blindsided when she finds out that bill is leaving her. no one deserves to be hurt like this. taylor says she is not trying to deny her being happy, but she doesn't want her to throw her trust around when it comes to a man like bill. she's going to have to keep her eyes open as she sure plans to. liam drops in on bill who is not looking too good. he tells liam that he had a really busy day and he wasn't intending to renew his vows tonight either. he walks in on a surprise vow renewal and he's not sure what the hell is he supposed to do. he didn't see bill at the office today so he must have been with her. karen tells the group that she changed her plans and flew in a day early to be here tonight for the board meeting, but that is tomorrow and tonight is all about bill and karen and her beautiful wife and how they are the stabilizing force of the company. the stock prices went up after they got married. everyone is more confident now with the idea of a married, committed bill spencer. she is very grateful to bill for his commitment to his wife and the company, but most of all she is honored to be there tonight as the two of them renew their vows. pam and donna join in and pam wants to know what is the scoop with her minister. she can't just give him that job to any old man of the cloth. she has to put her foot down. donna says that wedding is going to be pure hell.
katie tells brooke there are a lot of things that bill needs to explain. they were in the middle of getting married on the beach and there is no way bill could have arranged that accident. she says she is not so sure they can call it an accident anymore. wyatt tells ivy that ricardo willed him this diamond and he is just going to let it work its magic. deacon tells hope that he never did anything like she did when he was her age. he inspired women to live a life of meaning. he's glad he could help. brooke tells katie that she knows she wants to be there for ridge but feeding into his delusions is not going to help. she asks ridge if there was a problem with the site as they are getting married today. ridge says he doesn't know. ivy tells liam that it is intimidating but she is up for the challenge. she wants him to be in the video she is making for her mother so she can see what the office looks like now. hope asks deacon if he still has a thing for brooke. he says any guy who has been with brooke logan will have a little thing for her. but ridge is with her now and her mom is with bill. he has been working on a little something to help brooke and she will learn soon enough. he is not delusional. he thinks with a little time she will appreciate his efforts and cut him some slack.
taylor tries to explain to thorne that sometimes it is left to someone else to help a grieving parent explain a death to a child. it's come up a few times in her practice, but he's a good father and he could never do anything terrible to his daughter. just be yourself, be sensitive and loving and honest and she will understand that. alexandria comes in and wants to know if her mommy is all better yet. donna drops in on ridge and he wonders what she thinks he should do with all the photos of thorne in his mail. he figures when thorne gets back, he can yell at him and everything will be back to normal. she just thought she should check in on him since her big sister is not allowed to. nick tells brooke that she was on good behavior at darla's funeral, no peeling her clothes off, but her ball and chain has an idea about that. she wishes she knew how to keep that bottom line roaring back without peeling off her clothes. he tells her to forget it, this is not his business. he loves her and supports her and she can carry on. she's not sure how donna looks in her underwear, but she 'd like to see his tankers in sexy lingerie. phoebe is worried since she thought her mother was home with her. stephanie reassures her that nothing is going to happen to her mother, maybe she just wanted to stay at the chapel a little while longer. she knows guilt when she sees it. she admits she loves her mother and friends quarrel and they regret it, but it is all explainable and there is no one to blame, but herself. and if she is not mistaken
phoebe tells ridge that she is happy for him that ashley is his new woman. she respects her and she is classy so good for him. she's just happy he is happy with her. rick drops in on ashley and isn't happy to hear that she slept with ridge and now she is getting the third degree for it. she doesn't want ridge to hear about her and rick from anyone but her. she is not in the mood for a lecture from him about how bad he thinks ridge is for her. he's better for her than anyone has been in a very long time. he just needs one more day, he needs to be able to soften the blow for phoebe so she won't feel threatened by her and ridge. stephanie shows up at thorne's office and is surprised to see him drinking his lunch there. he wanted her to be darla, but no one is left alone there anymore. he wants everyone to just leave him alone. he should be over this and he is not. brooke tells donna that she made a mistake, but nothing horrible came out of it. donna reminds her that she will be a threat to the forrester's again, working here again. she can't wait to see how she is going to twist this around at the next hearing. she can not count on ridge, but she can count on donna. she goes to see her niece and nephew ; two generations of her family have been scarred by donna and there will not be a third. she and donna are both alike, both sluts with no sense of responsibility and there is nothing they can do to hurt her ; she is finished with both

quinn is singing on the beach in monaco. wyatt and steffy are down by the water and he asks if she is good. she says she is. he says he is going to live in the moment and right now that is pretty damn good. liam drops in on eric and says he planned to come over and fanboy all over him about his speech but the whole city of monte carlo beat him to it. eric says yes they have been very kind. he actually enjoys public speaking and stephanie used to say that he liked the sound of his own voice but she was wrong about that. he tells liam that he had never heard that point before about clothing and culture and protest so what eric said is absolutely true. when they feel defiant, when they are passionate they paint it on themselves on their bodies, on their faces and wear it on their shirts. he has an idea for a t - shirt that says my life was fuller before i met quinn fuller. what do you think he should sign him up for one? eric asks liam what is he going to do. the situation seems untenable. he knows he can't say much as quinn is his granddaughter but if liam won't give him the whole respect marriage speech, he thinks they are good. he asks eric if there is a man anywhere in the world who hasn't wanted a woman who is forbidden to him for one reason or another. time heals all wounds but they don't all heal properly. the one thing that life does well is surprise you. he's learned not to expect anything but the unexpected. he calls quinn and says this is a bad time but he wants to thank her
caitlin is basking in her good fortune. jarrett wants to know what happened between her and thomas when she was supposed to be on rick's arm, but found him kissing rick instead. ridge laments to brooke that darla's kiss with sally was an accident, and one that shouldn't have happened if thorne hadn't married the dimwitted secretary. he goes looking for thomas, but doesn't find him. rick and caitlin go to the forrester mansion to tell ridge and brooke about the showing being cancelled, and that thomas didn't come home after all. thomas finds amber outside the house, and they go inside. amber tells thomas that she thought she and rick had a chance, but he told her that rick isn't that kind of guy. when thomas hears that amber is defending rick, he storms out. ridge goes to see rick to talk some sense into him, but rick says it's too late. he's already seen that his stepbrother has the hots for his girlfriend.
thomas tells hope that she has to move on. she can take liam and put him where he belongs in her past. accept the life she has now, a life with him. she says they are meant to be in each other's lives but not in the way that he thinks they do. he says he is not upset with her. he knows she wants to take things slow and that is fine but they have all night. douglas tells liam that phoebe is beth. liam asks why he is saying this. why would douglas say this? douglas says because it is true. thomas tells him that he can not say beth's name again, not to liam or anyone. shauna comes in and tells flo that her dad's last name was storm. flo tells shauna that she can not keep this secret any longer. she is done with this. she tells her mother that she is going to tell hope the truth today. as soon as wyatt comes home she is telling him the truth. she trusts him and she does not know what will happen between them but she knows he will help her go to hope and liam. hope will finally know that their little girl is alive. hope asks thomas if douglas is okay. he assures her that he is fine. there is no reason to worry about him. steffy walks in and asks if this is about beth again as douglas should not be making up lies about her. she goes upstairs while liam tells her what he saw. he went in to check on the girls and he saw douglas looking at phoe beth and he was staring at her crib. he did not understand how he could be so certain.
the doctor tells steffy that her x - rays show that she has a few fractured ribs but they usually heal on their own. wearing a helmet saved her life today so she's very lucky. bill tells liam that it was not a hit and run accident ; the bastard that hit her was him. he swerved but it was too late. liam says it's not bill's fault but he 'd like to see her. brooke says she is awake and ridge is with her. wyatt and penny find sally passed out on the floor in her hospital bed and call 911. ridge comes in and asks the doctor what is wrong with his daughter. the doctor says she needs stronger meds and ridge asks what does he think? the doctor tells them she will be okay but needs more pain medication. bill says he wants a chance to apologize. ridge says he doesn't care what he wants ; just go home. bill keeps saying this is his fault and he wants steffie to hear it directly from him. steffydy wakes up and asks liam where her phone is. he tells her not to worry about the time or meetings or conference calls, just rest and rest. he says he has already called amelia and she will drop kelly off at the cabin. she thanks him and says it was hope's idea and she is sure kelly will love that. he vows he will always be there for her. she says she can not believe she almost missed out on time with her daughter because of some freak accident. she is a little banged and bruised but she is fine and he does not have to feel guilty. she wants to see kelly and asks him not to tell her that she is
hector shows up at taylor's. he tells her that she hasn't returned any of his calls and she must have not told the truth or she would be in jail right now. she can not confess to killing darla. they would be accessories after the fact. he reminds her that phoebe needs her ; she has to protect her. she is taking a risk ; this is dangerous. he knows she is scared and confused, but their lives can go on. taylor begs him to stop scaring her, but hector won't until they have a chance to talk about this further. he is worried about her daughter. ridge takes donna to brooke's for take - out and she says she is all his. she feels like she is stepping into her sister's shoes, but she wants to be more than brooke logan's little sister. he thinks this is a risk / reward and one that is going to pay off big time. stephanie tells thorne and thorne that she is relieved that taylor can handle just about anything with such grace and dignity. it's been a rough year for taylor and she is drinking too much.
amber stops thomas from making love to her by telling him that his first time should be special and should be with someone he loves. she tells him to go home and don't worry about caitlin. thomas thanks her for everything, but doesn't want to talk about what happened. ridge and brooke try to talk to him about it, but he leaves. nick confronts felicia about why she is still in l.a. she says she has a home. he tells her she needs to stop sailing in circles and be honest with herself. he sees her big fake teddy bear of a chest, but she says it's none of his business. he threatens to tell her mother if she ever talks to her. oscar catches amber and thomas kissing, but amber stops him before it goes any further. he warns her that if this gets out, the forrester's will be worse, and she won't repeat it. later, thomas calls amber again and she hangs up on him. ridge tells brooke that he isn't afraid that thomas is hiding something, but they will have to watch him.
ridge and phoebe catch up on each other's lives and she advises him not to break up with ashley for rick just because of her. don't support her just to be there for her. ashley tells stephanie that she doesn't mean to sound so negative, but she has no idea how to fix things with her son. she and ridge need to handle this on their own. she is going to go over to ridge's and apologize again. he will either forgive her or he won't, but either way they can get on with their lives. constantine shows up at forrester's with fliers and t - shirts and trash talk between rick and constantine. rick does his best to intimidate him, but constantine tells him that his ex does not intimidate him. phoe be votes for constantine and rick declares that he will do whatever it takes to win her back. stephanies tries to convince ridge that ashley is an exceptional young woman and he has a future with a wonderful woman out there. he has to be very adult and sophisticated about this and forgive her, otherwise he will spend the rest of his life wondering what might have been. he's not sure he wants to do that.
brooke finds stephanie lying on the floor on the living room floor. she knows she isn't hurt, but she can't get up. she tries to get her hands off of her, but all she can say is she was pushed. she calls 9 - 1 - 1 and then tells brooke that she is still here and she is very unstable. brooke reminds her that she pushed her and now she is going to play this to the hilt. aggie tells nick that it is all over the internet and now it is her brother and his girlfriend's mother's scandal. he thought he had pulled the plug on that. nick wants to know what the forrester's are doing with the venus campaign. whip tells nick to relax and be cupid for the photo shoot. bridget tells amber that she thinks nick wants her back at jackie m. she's been there longer and she knows what works there and the designs will work there. nick tells jackie that he doesn't want to shame her. he just wants to make sure her reality checks don't bounce. she does what she wants.
taylor and stephanie tell steffy to take her horse and get the hell out of here. brooke shows up and says she is not leaving until ridge hears everything that is going on. she tells ridge that she came all the way from point dume and she thought she was going to meet him there. she fills him in on the messages that she has been sending him all along, but he says he hasn't gotten any messages from her at all. he's even more upset when he finds out that she and thomas intercepted his messages on the computer. she knows it was wrong and she shouldn't have done it, but she can't risk losing him again. she asked brooke to just leave him alone, and she doesn't care about taylor or thomas or ridge. all she cares about is herself and what she wants. they could be happy and have a happy family together and she wouldn't let brooke ruin that. ridge has already said his vows so the wedding is virtually over if he will just finish it. whip calls jackie and invites her to come up to his apartment one floor above her loft. it's their own little version of upstairs, downstairs. he invites her in and she's shocked that he is living right above her. he fills her in on how they met and how they ended up in love. thomas tells thorne and felicia that he feels pretty stupid now that brooke is back in the picture.
brooke asks ridge if this wedding is what he wants, just say so and she will leave. he asks her to stay away. he asked her to respect his decision, but she can't do that when she doesn't really believe it is his. she's not going to tolerate brooke coming in here and accusing her of drugging ridge and making him marry taylor. she wants him to be 100 % committed to her ; she is not doing this today. katie calls donna and finds out from her that brooke came by horseback all the way out to point dume to meet ridge. now they are locked up in a room and no one knows what the hell is going to happen. she asks donna to stay there and be there for brooke when this is all over. ridge tells brooke that she is making this whole situation so much more painful than it has to be. no one held a gun to his head. brooke says if it weren't for taylor asking him to marry her, he wouldn't be here today as that is not what he wanted. maybe he thought he was really in love with taylor, but he isn't. taylor tells the family that she appreciates all of their love and support, but this will not happen. thomas asks brooke if she is happy now? ridge tells them to blame him if they want to blame someone, blame him. he happens to have two families he loves very much, but they needed more time to reach these understandings before taking this step. there will be no wedding today, but nothing else has changed. home is still home and that's where they are going right now. ridge calls brooke to see if
thorne tells his mother that he is going out of town, but he won't be alone. donna laments to jackie that she can make thorne happy and she can be a good mother to aly too. it's time stephanie finds out what it feels like to be taken from the most precious thing in brooke's life. nick tells jackie to let him and donna work on this in their office. brooke is on her way over to see the kids when donna gets a phone call that nick is back in town. she tells brooke that she will be with her while she enjoys the children. ridge chastises his mother for going so far as to ridicule brooke in front of the press. he doesn't want the children raised in emotional turmoil like bridget and rick were. he knows they can safe and secure living with him. nick surprises taylor with the return of his children. he's even more amazed when he sees how much bigger rj has grown.
bill tells liam that he did not think he would see him again. liam says he has a big mansion to rattle around in and to the victor goes the spoils. he says bill does not deserve to feel good about taking a wrecking ball to his life. but karma is a bitch and here he is alone in his house alone after shooting steffy down so he is proud of her. he tells ridge that he is going to go see kelly after work and he hopes that is okay with her. ridge says yes, every time he looks at kelly he feels like he can't breathe. that is the way he felt when kelly was born and he still feels that way now. she has straightened herself out and she is back to being the beautiful woman they all know and love but he does have some concerns. zoe calls out for harry and he does not respond so she asks him to get up. she tells xander that she needs him. harry is barely breathing and she came home today and he was barely breathing. she will take him to animal emergency and he can meet her there. xander tells hope that zoe is a good person and a good model and she won't let the company down. thorne tells her that he took the liberty of hiring zoe as a model. she is a little intense but not in a dangerous way. hope asks how xander feels about this and he says it is okay. he calls zoe and says he is in a meeting but he will get back to her. she says it already feels so empty. it is funny how much space their little presence takes up. he asks if harry has been slowing down and she says yes but he was still
dottie tells stephanie that she should be very upset with her, but she is not. this is going to be the biggest event ever and has already sold over $ 50,000 worth of tables. she just wishes her luck with the judges. the phones are ringing off the hook with questions. eric is stunned when he reads the headlines  `` forrester's royalty collection to compete with jackie m's  what in the world? `` everyone wants an explanation. whip tells bill that he trusts him to keep this under wraps on his end. he will be sittin'in the driver's seat if it all works out. bill tells whip that steph still has a wittle soft spot for eric and the company. brooke tells bridget that the sales were up only because of bill spencer, so don't give him any credit for that. katie tells eric they are on a collision course and there is no way to back out now. she will make sure their pr machine is kicked into high gear right away. whip confesses that he will take advantage of the fact that he is her old man and she isn't that scared to go up against him.
ridge tells brooke that this is a private matter and he has her complete support. she thanks him and thanks him for handling the press. he says he will do everything he can to get her daughter back home. brooke says she really doesn't want her staying over there under stephanie's influence. she is not going to let his mother steal her daughter. hope is still moping over oliver. she can forgive him, but she will never get over it. she can't understand what he was thinking. it's everywhere on the internet and in tabloids. she almost wishes she hadn't even known about it. hope says steffy swears to her that she had nothing to do with it and she has to believe her. all she knows is now the entire world knows about her mother and her boyfriend and she can not change it. the press is camped out at the gate and she now has to change her e - mail address and her phone number. ridge grabs brooke and tells her that he wants to speak to hope alone. he wants her to stop disparaging her mother. she needs to understand that. donna tells katie and stephen that taylor gave her a 25 % share of forrester. they both tell brooke not to be upset with her sister. they all felt this was the right thing to do. bill calls jarrett and says he has his eyes on the subject. he's at the bikini beach. bill tells him that he will be right there. he has to do a little exploratory work to see what her head is like now that she has 25 % of fc. he gives her a beer and congratulates her on becoming part owner, but they ca n

liam is surprised when hope tells him that she talked to ridge this morning ; he punched his dad. she can't believe he didn't care who got hurt and now her dad is going around punching people. liam assures her that steffy is probably embarrassed now and she will extend an olive branch to hope. she will probably even extend it to liam too if hope will accept it. nick shows up at bill's office and he is surprised to see justin barber there. bill tells justin that he is glad nick is here. he thinks nick will be glad he is. nick tells bill that he knows he had katie's best interest at heart. bill says yes and he feels like he owes it to her. bill punched him in the mouth, but he's going to hit him back and justin is going to help him do it. ridge tells brooke that he hit bill spencer. he wasn't listening to what he told him to stay away from his daughter. maybe now he will start acting like it instead of taking advantage of young girls. brooke tells ridge that she isn't sure that stephanie is the one being manipulated. bill is in a lot of pain right now and it was well earned. ridge is older and should be the one to be wiser. he made a commitment and he did the right thing. hope practices her speech for the fashion show. she is brooke logan's daughter, but she doesn't want to follow in her mother's footsteps. she wants to make her own mark on forrester's and that's what hope for the future is about. she tells liam that she loves her mom but she wants it to be
hope tells steffy that she has been a wonderful mother to beth and she will always be grateful to her but it is time for her to know her. she is coming home with her tonight. sally asks wyatt why he is here. he says it is a long story and he doesn't even know where to start. liam overheard a rather heated exchange between thomas and flo about a secret that hope was not supposed to find out about. he tells her that flo is not phoebe's birth mother but hope is. douglas was telling the truth ; phoe beth. he can not believe that thomas knew too. she says for his sake she is glad that he ended things with flo so he was not so blinded by their history together. he did not know that flo was capable of this kind of deception. he is sorry that he moved on so quickly with flo. she made one mistake and he dropped her. he reminds her that the secret she kept does not matter any more. she reminds him that there is an entire city of prince charminges out there and sally spectra can pick her one and pick him any time she wants. she thinks she knows him better than he does.
liam tells his dad that he did what anybody would have done  saved steffy's life luckily. but bill needs to stay away from her from now on. taylor tells brooke and ridge that their daughter owes her life to liam spencer. she was distracted and lost her balance and slipped in the bathtub. ridge says he will never forgive spencer, but taylor says at least his son is making up for it now. she's grateful that liam was there to save her life. she tells hope that she knows they don't get along, but she doesn't want anything terrible to happen to her. she may have to change her attitude about the logan's. after what she experienced yesterday, she is beginning to believe that for sure. oliver walks up and hears the story and asks what happened. she says she went to the doctor and no concussion, just a bad bump. she asks hope if she has seen liam today. hope says no, she has been working, but steffydy wonders if he feels like she does. after almost dying, she looks at liam totally different now.
hope tells brooke that she is not going to tell steffy that she has changed her mind and she wants her to come to the wedding. brooke says that is a good goal but let's save that for a different day. this is her wedding and they can not take any chances. hope says she wants steffie to come and she does not want her mother to feel alone. taylor is a loose cannon in the best of scenarios but not on her wedding day to liam. brook calls taylor and asks if she is still in town. she would like to see her. hope tells liam that she realizes there is someone missing from the wedding guest list that should be. liam tells her that he asked wyatt to be his best man. he figured after what happened last time and the pressure he was under, it would be good to have wyat stand up for him this time guilt free. hope is happy to hear that he accepted. she says she has a good feeling about this. they are a family and they need to rise above all of this and this wedding will be a huge step forward. she hopes liam is right. he says he hopes she is. he tells hope that he is going to take off now so she can have some time to herself. she tells him that her dad oohs and ahhs over kelly and then leaves as soon as she goes down for a nap and she knows where she stands. ridge walks in and says are you with him at all? he remembers when he and hope had twins and he and her mom would fall asleep in the middle of their conversation. ridge says no, this is a lot easier with thomas running around. brookes calls t
brooke tells marcus that eric was not poisoned. she wants him to think about what he is saying. these are serious allegations. marcus says it depends on what he thinks owen is after. he doesn't know all the pieces to the puzzle, but owen shouldn't be hanging around donna and he's at the house right now. he calls steffy and tells her he is on his way to the hospital and will explain everything to her when he gets there. ridge tells bridget that he is sorry if he made a mistake. he was ready to take eric off the ventilator. he apologizes to eric for how close they came to losing him and he is so sorry. he hopes he can have another chance. he needs eric to come back and he will show him how much he loves him. jackie comes in and hugs eric and apologizes. she says she is sorry for the family and she will come back. ridge stops her and says visiting hours aren't up yet, so she can stay. she tells eric none of this would have happened if he would have made his life with her. bridget tells ridge that he has to stop blaming himself. he did what he thought was necessary. brooke tells him he wasn't being selfish. she didn't want him to die ; she wanted him to get better and stay with his dad. she reminds him that when they get married, eric will be right there with them.
flo tells hope that all she can do now is try to make it right with her. hope says she was told her baby died. flo says she knows she can not make that right but she does not want to lose hope. and she will do whatever it takes to prove they can trust her again. shauna tells ridge and brooke that she is not saying flo did anything wrong. she is just asking for a little forgiveness. ridge says they do not care about flo's intentions but her actions that will land her in prison. wyatt tells liam that his nightmare is over and he is incredibly happy for him. liam says it is true. for the first time it does not feel like a dream anymore. beth is alive and his brain is still struggling to process it. he says he thinks it is more than a congrats kind of situation. he tells them his dad and justin are on the way over. he hopes they don't mind. he told them he was coming over. bill is surprised since he thought hope would be there with his granddaughter. bill says he has a lot to make up for. justin asks liam if steffy had the baby the whole time. he can't believe the doctor was able to pull this off. flo tells hope again that she did not plan any of this. if she had known what reese was involved in she never would have gotten involved in this. hope can not believe she is supposed to forgive her just because this was not her idea. and just because thomas knew about beth and threatened her life. she knows that is not an excuse and she should have still come to her and she knows hope can forgive her now. but what about before that  before th
brooke and andy make love. taylor tells nick that if he wants to call brooke or go over to see her, she is okay with that. she trusts him and that is the reason she married him. he's conflicted, but she's okay with it. she confides in him that she has this tendency to think she is right all the time, and she is afraid of the doorbell ringing and thinking it is brooke. she wants him to go over there and tell brooke that they are both on the same side and there isn't a chance in hell that she will be going to the courthouse tomorrow. eric tells stephanie that she just can't let go. hope and r.j. are not her kids and never will be. she keeps trying to turn this into her battle, but no one else wants to fight. andy tells brooke to leave ; he won't do that if she ever wants to see his kids again. he tells her to call the police again and tell them that she invited a guy over and he roughed her up a little bit, but it was small price to pay for the greatest sex of her life. and if she calls them again, she will hear those words again tomorrow at the custody hearing. she has a choice ; she can make andy sweat or get her kids back.. what is she going to choose?
hope holds baby phoebe and tells liam that she is glad that justin is going to be using her since carter is out of town. she wants to concentrate on their future. ridge tells brooke that he knows what thomas is doing. he is avoiding everything. brooke says yes but he can only do that for so long. now that the criminal justice system is involved and flo and reese are in custody, they will want to talk to anyone who knew that beth was alive and thomas will be on that list and there will be consequences. ridge says he will help thomas through this but he can't do that if he doesn't know where he is. douglas comes in and ridge tells him they do not know where his daddy is right now but that is nothing to worry about. they are proud of him for telling the secret about beth and he is their hero. thomas tells vinny that he feels like an idiot. he appreciates him letting him crash here while he tries to reclaim his life but this is not it. just a married man living apart from his wife and crashing on a buddy's couch like college roomies. he can not trust anyone except hope. and liam is over there with steffy right now taking advantage of hope. he has to get her away from liam for good this time. hope tells justin that she can not believe what an easy baby she is. justin says he is happy to help in any way he can. hope asks if he has spoken to carter about the adoption. he says yes and he feels terrible for the role he played in keeping beth away from hope. liam says that is not carter's fault.
liam asks hope again if she will marry him. she hesitates and he asks if she is all right. she needs a minute alone. she tells him that she just needed a minute to get herself together. he's sorry that he caught her off guard ; he didn't mean to pressure her. she says no, it was so him. it was crazy and charming and romantic, but obviously something went wrong. she laments that she loves how quirky liam can be and how he can make her laugh, but she had no idea this wasn't going to turn out the way she wanted it to be when he proposed. marcus tells the press that when forrester throws a show, anything can happen and he wants to know why they think this is the hottest ticket in the fashion industry. ridge, eric and thorne want to know what is going on. steffy tells them that hope is not ready for an intimate relationship with liam and that is what this is all about. taylor tells brooke and stephanie that she knows brooke doesn't want to hear this, but liam is over - compensating for feelings he shouldn't have for hope. brooke says no more psychobabble ; let's remain positive. he is in love with hope ; he has been for a very long time and she was just nervous and unprepared. she is using this to come between hope and liam.
wyatt tells liam that he is glad he came. it was a quick and easy elopement and he can do this. rick and maya tell wyatt that the photo shoot was a huge success with the diamond in paris on the yacht and the press was lapping it up. bill says of course they ate it up ; liam knows how to work the crowd. w yatt says he did not do anything ; it was all hope and the diamond. hope tells them that she is not wearing the diamond ; she accepted it but it is for the line and is on display now in a boutique and going around europe. quinn says she hopes it brings as much success to the line as it did to his personal relationship. katie tells the logan girls that they will watch out for one another so he better be on his toes and be an ideal husband as they will be watching. hope thanks brooke for inviting deacon. he says he can not believe his little girl is now all grown up and getting married. he's finally back in her life and she runs off to find a husband. she says he knows a girl will always need her dad, so it means a lot to him. he thinks rick needs a little rescuing so he and hope leave. maya tells rick to take a look at those photos when he gets a chance and tell her what he thinks. she tells him no rush on those photos as she knows he has a lot of work to do while his wife is out of town. hope comes back to the party and quinn tells her that she can leave if it would make her feel more comfortable. hope says no, this is a party and she has a whole new life ahead
oliver welcomes brooke back to the office with a big smile on his face. he tells her that he and hope are back together. brooke says she knows it will take some time, but now that hope has forgiven oliver maybe she is not too far behind. hope tells brooke about last night and all the wonderful things oliver did for her. she did not think it could get any better than it did when he kissed her. all her visions of bad dreams went away. she wishes things could be the way they used to be, but she understands that she needs a little more time. thomas tells his sis that he has a bone to pick with his dad for kicking steffy out of the company. taylor says that was a very painful time for his dad and sister, but there is no need to make them feel guilty now. ridge tells thomas and taylor that there have been some major changes around here. donna no longer owns half of her grandfather's shares and bill spencer has bought them back from her, but he is not getting away with it this time. the forrester's are firing back in a very big way. liam tells bill that he does not know what all of this has to do with him. he's just an intern. bill tells him that he just could not keep his zipped about the tribute so now he is dealing with a lawsuit. justin says he will do whatever he can to help, but bill will do better than that. he got spencer publications into this mess and liam will get them out. bill warns him to hold on. he isn't through with liam yet. ridge explains to thomas that taylor gave her shares to
bridget and dante prepare to tell nick the truth. she tells him that she lied to him and told him she aborted their child, but she was wrong. she practically threw him into brooke's arms when she threw him in her arms. brooke tells nick that she has been trying to reach bridget all night and all day to try to get her to come home. nick tells brooke that she was right about everything she said yesterday. he doesn't even know what he was thinking getting into a relationship with bridget ; it's been one catastrophe after another. he tells her bridget deserves to be happy and if he could give her that, but they've both hurt each other enough. he's going to go back to the only lady he has ever understood. thorne stops by taylor's office to check on ridge and the kids. he thought she might need his help running interference with brooke, since she hasn't learned her lesson to stay out of other people's business. taylor tells him she has her own problems, but that's not why she wanted to see him. she needs his help to talk to ridge, to help him sort out his feelings and get him to open up to her.
wyatt tells hope that it's time to go home. liam says he was there in paris and it doesn't make any difference. wyatt says no, but he just heard what his dad told him downstairs and he also heard that liam was going to keep it to himself. enough people know already so it might as well as hope know it now. she knows for a fact how unreliable liam is and how he never could put her first. he tells her to go downstairs and start saying her goodbyes as he will be down in a few minutes. he says he is sorry it had to go down like this but he thinks they always knew it would. he knows she understands that the wedding reception is wrapping up downstairs and she can not change that. quinn tells deacon that hope was horrified when he told her. she was not forgiving bill like she always does. deacon says well she does forgive. if she didn't he would not be here today or any other day for that matter. she says it is not because he is so well behaved. bill tells brooke that he thinks it is important to get a second opinion on ridge's medical condition. he will fly in the best specialist in the world. brooke says she does not think brain surgery is going to make him more artistic. bill says he did not say it was brain surgery. ridge hates him and he hates his guts and if he can turn brooke against him then he may as well turn her against him too. she cries that it was bill who lied to her, not ridge. ivy comes in and tells hope this is all her fault. if it were not for her they would be celebrating a very different marriage right now. l
ridge hugs brooke and says he is so sorry for what happened. she doesn't want to talk about it. she just wants to get it out of her head. he begs her not to press charges. she tells him about andy. he's a stalker and has been following her around ever since she met him at the café russe. ridge vows to find andy and make him pay. clarke tells jackie and nick that brooke's designs stink. nick says she is going through a difficult time right now, but she will come through it. phoebe tells rick that she wishes he didn't know her so well. she keeps sending him mixed signals and she does not want to let him down like that anymore. he says he knows it sounds funny, but he has always dreamt of making love to her and he respects that she wants to wait. she's finally listening to what everyone has been saying. they love each other, but for them to be happy they need to be on the same page. she says maybe that will happen someday, but right now she is not ready. she kisses him and tells him be happy. that is what she wants for him.
eric tells quinn that this is too much. this family can not deal with another loss. he is still in shock that thomas knew about beth all this time and kept it a secret from everyone including hope. it all goes back to shauna and flo. she says she knows he is worried about thomas but flo and shauna had nothing to do with thomas's fall. eric says the damage has been done. if their family has to suffer the consequences then so does flo and her mother. it was a big mistake to let them come stay at their house. he hates this. quinn says flo is not a monster. she wanted her to be his daughter - in - law. she is a sweet, thoughtful young woman and thomas has made mistakes but eric still thinks he is inherently a good person. shauna rushes to the jail and hugs flo and says she is glad she is there. she can not stand to see her locked up. she will figure out a way to get her out. flo says this is where she belongs. she did something illegal and horribly wrong and she did nothing about it. why should anyone do anything for her? shauna begs her not to lose faith. let her talk to quinn ; she is not going to let her rot in jail. she knows from experience how easy it is to get in over her head and one bad decision leads to another. she tells flo that she has always had her best interest and she still does. just have a little faith in her mom. there is not even a trial set up yet and the real criminal is thomas buckingham so she needs to trust her. hope tells brooke that she saw what she wanted to see  the guy who got
bill tells brooke that he regrets his part in this and he will do everything he can to help ridge recover but he is in no way going to lose her over this. she says he really doesn't realize what he has done to ridge. he says he knows what he did and he knows the part ridge played in it and it has done them too. but he knows she is the only woman for him and he is not going to give up on them. brooke says that is no comparison to ridge losing his talent. he will get it back. bill says they can not put their lives on hold ; they need to move forward. they can begin their life together tonight. she laments that it is complicated. katie is in love with ridge and she will still feel hurt when she sees brooke with bill. he tells her that is not an option ; they will be together again. he asks her to let him spend the night. quinn tells deacon there is no way brooke will marry bill after this. he needs to make his move on brooke now. they will have grandchildren, holidays, family, something her son has never had. she wants this so much for wyatt. but they have to act now. bill is relentless. he is with brooke right now and the longer they wait the greater the chance he has of getting her to marry him again. if they don't they will lose their chance to be a true family. she tells him their children are depending on them and they have not said it but they want to see their parents together for the first time in their lives. she has paved the way so now it's deacon's turn to go make it happen. he walks in and
quinn begs sheila to tell her what will happen now. sheila says she will get what she deserves for cheating on eric the way she did with ridge. quinn tells her to go ahead and choke her out. she is going to be the one to tell eric just how crazy she is and she is out of this house tonight. steffy asks liam what is wrong. he says he is just thinking about the lie that his dad keeps perpetuating about caroline. pam tells them there was a fire at spectra. sally tells saul and shirley that she is not all right and this is the worst thing that could have happened. she knows it was stupid but she does not know how it could have been any worse. justin tells bill that the fire is out and spectra fashions is now out of the game. bill says he will give it to the spectra's. they are a scrappy little bunch but they are no match for single - minded determination. he tells justin that he has always found it frustrating and disappointing when opponents over the course of his life have refused to listen to reason and logic. why didn't those clowns just move out when he asked nicely? justin says now is not the time to bring attention to spencer publications. he knows bill wants to start construction but considering all that went down tonight his best strategy is patience. he will sit back and wait for the inevitable. without insurance, garrison will be begging him to take that rat's nest off his hands. liam tells sally that he saw what was left of spectra and he is glad she is all right where she is. saul tells darlita and coco that it
katie is surprised that donna would want to marry thorne after all that stephanie has done to brooke. but donna assures her that she can handle her, she will be fine. katie is delighted to hear that the wedding will be at the forrester's, but is surprised when she finds out it is going to be donna and thorne. she's not sure donna isn't just doing this to get back at her, but she assures her she is in love with thorne and they will have a wonderful life together. ridge confronts andy and demands to know who helped him get the key and how he got into brooke's house. andy taunts him that he had the time of his life and he's going to get away with it. and if he goes down, someone will be with him, he won't be alone in hell. the security guard bursts in and andy out of his hiding place and takes him away. ridge fills brooke in that andy is dead, someone must have tipped him off and set him up. he shows her her house key, the one she had under the flowerpot, but no one knows how andy found it. he apologizes for doubting her last night. he knows who she is and he loves her and if she ever gets in trouble, she can tell him anything, no matter what, he will always be on her side.
wyatt tells steffy that he wants her to come back home. she says she can not come home. he says yes she can. she is his mother and she is in his life now. wyatt says he knows he can not control everything but maybe she can try and control her grandfather. pam tells charlie that she is going to need a lot more than water to get her through this day. charlie tells quinn that no one wants her here except for the ceo and he will be watching every move she makes. he will search her bag, his purse, she will take nothing away from here. she tells him that he might want to talk to eric first as she knows how he and pam feel about her. he tells pam that he has made it clear to both of them that if quinn reverts to her former behavior then it is over for the job too. quinn says she is sorry and she will make it up to pam for all the hurt she has done to her. she does not expect her forgiveness but she is not that person anymore. sasha tells zende that thomas is an amazing guy and she hopes he will tell her that he is happy for her. liam thanks thomas for stopping by. thomas says go ahead and let him have it if he wants to do the down and dirty. he set it up and he wants what is best for his sister and in thomas's opinion that is liam and that is why he is here now. he knows it is killing his brother but steffie's safety has to take precedence over all this. he thinks she needs to get out of this marriage. he asks thomas if she is giving up.
hope tells thorne that she hopes with the success of the fashion show they will get more orders for the line and perhaps a budget increase. she tells liam that she loves having him at the office every day. steffy drops in on liam and they discuss their first ultrasound. hope says it was amazing to see the baby in 3 - d. it was like an honest to god miracle happening inside her. she has been on this journey and there is so much joy ahead. quinn asks thorne if he has seen the marketing strategy and he says katie is working on it, among other things. ridge walks in and says so this is happening, she is going for sole custody of will. he does not understand this. he is not sure bill should be able to swoop in and swoop out of will's life as he pleads his case. thorne says will misses his dad but when he sees him, he shuts down. lately he has not wanted to see him at all. ridge says he knows who bill is and he knows why will is having these problems. and he's not sure he should be allowed to say anything about it, not to upset mr. bill spencer. will tells his mom that his dad does not like him. he used to spend more time with him but he stopped. he wonders if it is all his fault. she says nothing is his fault and she will talk to him later. there is a knock on the door and it is bill. he says he is here to see his son. he knows he has been missing in action and will is mad at him and he needs a chance to make it up to him. will says school does not start until next week. bill says okay
stephanie notices that the kids are awfully quiet this morning and wonders if anything is wrong. hope and rj beg to see their mommy. stephanie explains that abby has a play date with heather down the street and hope wants to take her instead of her. ashley stops by to see ridge and asks if she has heard from him. she tells her that she saw him last night at the concert and he was going to go see brooke and find out why she didn't show up to hear rick. she's sure she is upset and probably too upset to ever see ridge again. brooke wakes to a breakfast of waffles in her face by ridge who has been up since the crack of dawn. he wishes he could have been there that night to protect her, but he's here now and that means everything. taylor is shocked to hear that nick is suing the forrester's for trademark infringement. ridge calls ashley and apologizes for not returning her call. he tells her he had to pick up the kids and he will be in touch with her later. he calls felicia and leaves her a message that he is taking the kids home and dropping the custody suit. he never should have signed those papers in the first place, so he is going to drop the suit and take them home. they need her and they will never be separated again.
jackie urges nick to tell her his true feelings for brooke. nick insists that he is happy with bridget. jackie is thrilled about her first grandchild, but wants him to follow his heart. he argues that he grew up without a father and he's not going to do that to his kid. dante visits bridget and wants to know what happened with nick. she explains that she was a wreck for a couple of days after her conversation with nick and that she wants to put all that junk behind her and move on with her life. she tells dante that he deserves so much better than to be someone's plan b. she assures him that it 'll be a few months before he will meet someone new. gabby and thomas kiss passionately and profess their love for each other. thomas asks gabby to meet him at the cabana in a few minutes.
bill tells jackie that he wanted a formal proposal. he wants to be in business with her. he will give her the financial boost she needs and promote the hell out of jackie m. now is it a deal or not? steffy tells liam that of course he is frustrated. he professed his love to hope on one knee and she still says she is not ready. he says she wants to wait, he respects that, but he wants hope. she says then he will have to play by her rules. he's proven to hope how committed he is and yet she is in paris with bill spencer. hope tells thomas that she forgives him for his part in stephanie's lie, but what he did was so wrong. it almost destroyed her mom's life. brooke tells taylor that she is worried about liam. if he is her daughter's fiance, he should be able to trust her. she does trust liam, it'ssteffy she doesn't trust. thomas asks hope if he can talk to her for a few minutes. he apologizes again for lying to her mom. hope says she realizes now that he was just sucked into it too, but she can forgive him. he did the right thing by going along with his grandma's lies. taylor tells brooke that she was just there to try to find her herself. she knows hope went out of town and she is afraid she might be with liam now. ridge calls justin and tells him that the marone's will accept the deal and before you know it he will own half the company and forrester won't know what hit'them. ridge tells bill that he
brooke is shocked that ridge had a vasectomy. not every woman wants to have children but caroline does and he can't allow her to throw that away because of him. he says when she left here she was hurt and confused but he hopes when she wakes up it will all make sense to her. he explains that he was living in paris on his own and he figured it was time. he had raised his kids. he did not tell caroline about the vasectomy because he knew she would stay with him and he didn't want that. maybe he should have told her about it but that would have confused things even more. steffy yells at wyatt that ivy is out of control and he needs to do something about it. she wants every copy of the video destroyed. she is through trying to reason with them. ivy thinks she can control her with that video and make it look like he committed murder. no, that game is over. she won't let that happen. she will not live in fear for the rest of her life as long as ivy has that video. she knows he is a good guy and she used to think ivy was a good person but now she has changed. she has to protect herself. she asks him if he is going to help her or not. caroline wakes up in bed with thomas and does not know what happened. he tells her that she does not have to talk about that right now. he would not leave her. she cries that she can not remember anything. he told her how he felt for her and she reached out to him and asked if he could show her. they made love. she screams no, no, do not touch her. wy
liam tells bill that he wishes he had come to him the moment he found out caroline wasn't sick. caroline says it is something she never should have gone along with. bill says enough is enough. enough with the apologies. he hatched a plan to reunite his niece with the father of her baby and he would do it again. liam says just like bill would have spectra set on fire again. bill denies it and says liam said it to his face in this room. bill tells liam and caroline to tell them that none of it is true. charlie tells sheila that it is disgusting the way they are looking at each other. sheila tells ridge that he knows he wants to kiss his father's wife so he needs to do it. but charlie says no, this is going nowhere. it is time to let them out. she says no ; she decides when they get out. today he is standing up for what is right. bill welcomes justin in and says from this point forward all questions will be directed to his attorney. he didn't even have to summon him. justin says he was summoned by liam. bill asks if liam wants to tell him what. he says he is in charge now and he will run this ship just fine while bill is behind bars. he will make some changes, get them involved in some charity work. he tells bill to enjoy his do - gooder revolution while it last but he wants it over with as soon as possible as he can get back and undo whatever damage this idiot causes. wyatt tells his dad that he doesn't think he will be coming back. lt. baker says eventually it happens to even the smartest of criminals. l
ridge, thorne, felicia and eric ask their dad if he is really here with them now. stephanie tells them to call back to the hospital and tell them they are keeping his wheelchair. he's missed the world and wants to get a good look at it. owen brings donna home and tells her that she has been a great wife to eric and she doesn't have to prove it or prove it to herself. she can accept what happened or she can keep on hurting herself by refusing to accept what has happened. she's just as far away from eric when they are in the same room, so if she needs someone to listen to her without judgment, then she is there. he won't push her. brooke stops by and taylor tells her this is not a good time. she wonders if she ever calls first when there is a problem with jack. rick admits there is something going on between him and jack, he is just not bonding with brooke. they both love jack and want what is best for him, so brooke shouldn't feel judged. taylor asks brooke what is so broken in her that brooke finds it so hard to love.
brooke urges nick to let go of bridget. let the right thing happen for all of them. sally tries to convince thomas and gabby that their marriage must be annulled. she shows them how much money she has made for her. thomas is shocked when she shows him the check she wrote him for his first year of tuition. she tells him that in a year or two when ridge and taylor will see them for who they really are and come crawling back to eat their words, then he will be richer than any bachelor's degree could ever make him. eric tells jackie that she is being held prisoner in his house for 90 days. he doesn't want her to ruin brooke and nick's relationship on her own time. he takes her home. bridget asks dante if it bothers him to see brooke with nick.
justin questions donna as to why she left him like that a lifetime ago when she was just out of high school. he thought they had something special, but then she was gone, never another word. she apologizes again and says whatever pain she caused him back then, she is sorry. stephanie is surprised to find out from eric that he and donna are adopting marcus. marcus plays a game of basketball with zach and then tells katie that the most incredible thing has happened. he found his father. justin asks donna about her marriage to eric. she's happy with him, but not in the way they thought they knew him. he's a high powered exec, bill spencer's right hand man and he often wondered what would happen with him if his injury hadn't been such a bad thing. he confides in her that he loves business. it takes up almost all his time. she asks about his wife and he confesses they are divorced. he didn't want an apology, but it's still nice to get one. she tells him about her mother's alzheimer's and how she 'd like to come back to l.a. and spend as much time as she can with her. he tells her that maybe he is one of those guys that just isn't meant to have children. donna confides to him that she and eric are still close, but her mom is in paris and she doesn't know if she will come back. then justin shows up at the door and interrupts them. he asks marcus how long he has been there and marcus introduces him to justin barber, a reporter from sp
ridge tells craig to do his job. he wants him to rule against bill. justin tells bill that he can not influence the judge in this. bill says he pays him for his advice so he might as well use it. brooke shows up and says she got his message ; the custody hearing is next week. she hates that it has come to this but bill says it doesn't have to. she has already talked to katie and she will not change her mind. she tells him to try one more time to make her understand how bad this will be for will. carter tells thorne to take his time ; the hearing is fast approaching. thorne says they are talking about bill spencer here and given his history it is definitely a concern so they need to be the family will needs. he thinks they should get married now so the judge can see that they are a stable family. he asks if will is on board with this and carter says he is. if he is and he has a positive reaction to thorne, then it will work in their favor. katy says bill was ignoring will and neglecting him and then thorne came into his life and he proved that there was a man he could count on. bill will always be will's father and she is not going to diminish that. she will foster that relationship for as long as it is healthy but she hates to say it but fatherhood and will and bill do not fit. he did that with liam and wyatt and now he is doing it with will. it does not matter if she is married and it should not matter but it does matter. bill is an occasional father and he sees will on his terms and his terms only. and with th
nick tells brooke she can't come to the wedding. if she wants to be there for bridget, then she won't be there. he doesn't know if he can say the vows if she is there. brooke panics. how is she going to make this work? bridget pops in on eric and asks him to make her another dress. she wants her mother there and wants her to feel like she is a part of this. she promises she will not go through with the wedding if brooke isn't there. eric agrees to scrounge something up for her. ridge is surprised to hear from dante that he and brooke are dating. he's even more surprised when he hears that bridget is getting married tonight.
ivy gives quinn a beautiful bracelet from her private collection that she thought she could use as something borrowed. she says it is so beautiful and she still can not believe it is her wedding day and she is going to be mrs. eric forrester. eric tells charlie and pam that in spite of how ridge and steffy and others feel about quinn, his family will come together today for his wedding. he tells them it will be a full house, just the way he likes it. he wants it to be a festive, joyous occasion with champagne flowing all night long, martinis flowing and hors d'oeuvres passed out before the ceremony. he appreciates their enthusiasm and hopes they will see the beauty in quinn tonight. he likes everything on the list and wants to be sure that when quinn comes down the stairs that she hears the bridal chorus. quinn tells ivy that eric is the sweetest man on this planet and it still amazes her how much he has changed her life. she wants everything today to be flawless and she hopes the rest of the family will do the same. ivy says she knows she really cares for him and he is very lucky to have her. she vows she will spend every day of her life making him happy. thomas, zende, wyatt, felicia, rick, maya, ridge, thorne and rick say they can not turn their back on their father now. he needs them right now. thorne says he is his best man and he can't leave him hanging so he is going over. ridge says no, he is not going anywhere.
wyatt tells sally that he is dying down here and wants her to say that she will marry him. he wants to know if she needs more convincing or another romantic speech. he says he feels like they are better together than apart and he 'd like to be married to her. brooke tells ridge that she understands why he does not trust bill. he hurts people and that includes his son and his wife and he is not sure he will always be there for katie. but she is strong and no one deserves happiness more. she tells him about beth being alive and they are all so excited about that even though she is in pain right now. sally tells wyatt that she is still in love with him but she never fully gave herself over to him. she needed reassurance and he moved on so quickly with flo. she is not with him for his money ; that is not why she fell in love in the first place. she wants him and she wants this. she says he always knows how to come through for her so she can't imagine her life without him. wyat proposes again and she says yes. she will be his wife. she kisses him and says it is going to be one hell of a ride. he kisses her back and says she has changed his life for the better in so many amazing ways and he can not wait to marry her.
brooke tells stephanie that she doesn't need a paramedic ; she just needs a good acting coach. she pushes her and she wakes up on the couch. brooke scoffs that she just pulled this on her a couple of months ago and now she is pulling it on her again. nothing can kill her except a stake through her heart. she thinks she needs to call the paramedics. thomas tells ridge that he feels badly for bridget, but there has to be something they can do to help. ridge tells thomas that it was bad enough that the truth came out about bridget's baby at the fashion show, now it's all over the internet. he just never thought it would come out about his wife's other daughter. jackie tells owen that this is no way to behave in front of the goddess of love. rick tells jackie that he sees where things are headed. he and bridget are suppressing their attraction for one another, but it won't be long before they are all going to get together as one idyllic family and he will be there with his lady venus and be worshipping her at the altar of her intoxicating beauty. she begs him to stop. fisticuffs solves nothing. owen says rick is the one that is trying to come between them. he's put his wife in an impossible situation with the situation with his sister and owen's infidelity. and today at this fashion show it blows up in her face and she is publically pummeled with questions about the future of her marriage. she should be asking herself that very question herself. he tells her there is one thing he has over her that she will never have and never will.
pam finds stephanie with the bottle of champagne. she doesn't care what she does with it. she can drink it, throw it away, use it for cooking, cooking, she can do whatever she wants, but she does not want to ask her how she feels. for god sakes, that's all she wants people to do is ask her what she feels  how does she feel. pam tells her that she is worried about her. she knows how much she depends on her. that is why she is concerned. she thinks she is working way too hard. she tells her not to worry her little head ; she will always be there to take care of her. donna tells justin that it is true. he is his son. he has a son. all these years and never he knew. she did not tell him because she didn't want to ruin his life. they were in high school and he had so many opportunities in front of him and she couldn't mess it up. she begs him not to hate her. steffy tells owen that she will get help ; she is going to get help. owen sees her staring into her coffee cup like there was a bug floatin'in it and wants to know what is going on. she confides in him that sometimes it's just hard to know the right thing to do. he sees something going on behind those beautiful eyes of hers and wants her to tell him what it is. she says she is worries about her grandma. she's going through something. he says she has supercharged energy and energy that she never seems to stop moving. it must be from all the stress and tension in her life. she has jackie
caroline asks the doctor if it is possible that she is carrying another man's child. it was just one night and a mistake, but she can not leave here without finding out who the father is. brooke tells ridge that caroline loves him no matter what. maybe she will be a little disappointed but she will come around in the end. now he has to tell her about the vasectomy and why he kept it from her. wyatt tells ivy that he has been staring at a computer screen for the better part of the day. he just wishes his dad had not shot down his fashion house idea. she thanks him for trying. she says steffy can not get away with this. she should not have used that video but she deleted it. she will go back down to forrester and try to talk to steffie again and maybe this time she will get through to her. ivy tells quinn that she misses working with her at fc. and even pam's lemon bars. quinn says if this guy is in her corner, he will be there for life unlike liam. she can count on ivy in a way she could not with liam, so what is she going to do then? thomas is glad that steff has him on her side. except when he is not. he does not want to get on the boss's bad side. he and his dad started off a little rocky but now he is on the design team. she asks how it is really going given his history with caroline. ridge tells brooke that he knows she wants to help but caroline went to the doctor to make sure everything was in place so it would never happen. as long as he is with her
ridge tells brooke that he and taylor are separated and have been for awhile, and he needs her. brooke wants to know what exactly does he need her to do. hector shows taylor a picture of a firefighter, megan lester, who died in a fire a couple of months. he tells her that it would have been a real tragedy if she hadn't been a firefighter if she 'd let someone in her life talk her out of it. eric has a visit from jackie who is surprised to see him again. he admits that he wasn't certain how much her ex - husband knows about them. he is glad they waited to get together as it gives them so much to look forward to. they discuss their love lives and how unlucky they have been in love in the past. he can't forget about brooke and stephanie, but there must be someone out there for them. ridge doesn't want to talk about taylor. he fills brooke in on how he thought he had it all figured out with the runway show. he would challenge thomas to a showdown on the runway and after the showing they would tally up the numbers. if he won, thomas would annul his marriage to gabby and resign from spectra and be going back to college, but if he didn't, then taylor and brooke would accept gabby as his wife. she thinks there is no way he is going to lose. ridge tells her taylor can not deal with his feelings for brooke. she reminds him that what she does and who she does it with stopped being his business the night he renewed his vows with taylor
ridge tells brooke that will is a perfect fit for thorne and katie and he is going to be the father that he always needed. he will be there tomorrow and he will not pull any punches. brooke tells ridge that she wishes he were not involved in this. he says he does not like to be on the opposite side when it is so important. but he will do anything he can to help her get full custody. he knows she has a soft spot for bill but he loves her and she has to accept that too. wyatt tells liam that it sounds like all the trappings of a forrester wedding. liam says yes but there is a long story behind it and it is not like the forresters haven't had the practice. and he has been asked to testify at the custody hearing and he wonders if liam feels like he is doing the same thing for his dad as he is for his father, how does he feel about that. thorne tells kate that it is their wedding day and they can not skip past it. she says she just wishes they could skip past tomorrow. she just does not want to think of it as the day before something terrible happened. he assures her everything will be just fine tomorrow. bill will thank them for that one day and bill will have a stable family to raise his son. bill tells justin there is one more thing he wants him to do for him and that is to call a surprise witness. he is calling brooke. she gets a call from justin barber that she has been subpoenaed to testify on bill's behalf at the hearing tomorrow. justin says he realizes it is last minute but bill is counting on her help and he needs her
brooke tells ridge that she can not believe this is happening  katie in kidney failure. she thanks him for taking the test to be a donor and he promises them they will figure it out. she says she has been too busy with her own life to even notice that she was sick. and as long as thomas is out there, she doesn't know when he is going to strike. he is not the monster, but he is in pain and needs help. brooke says thomas can not just go away for a while and then come back. no one who kept that secret about beth deserves a second chance. ridge says douglas is his son and he will not turn his back on him. thomas tells douglas that he is mad at him because he disobeyed him. he told him not to do something and douglas did it anyway. douglas calls him a hero, but thomas says no, douglas defied him and didn't listen to him. it's all because of douglas's dry skin. he wants to know where is the loyalty to his father. shauna tells flo that she wishes she could have another chance with ridge, and with the logan's too, but it is becoming very clear that will never happen. flo tells her that she already knows all of this is her fault. if it had not been for wyatt proposing to sally, she never would have known this was happening. she tells shauna there is so much wrong with what she just said, she is not even going to ask. flo if she has heard anything else about her family. she shows her the pictures on her phone of ridge at a charity event and a movie premiere. flo says she is
harry tries to stop shane and phoebe from being roughed up by hector, but hector won't let shane go until he gets to the bottom of what it is hector wants. shane confesses to taylor that he knows she hit darla with her car and he is the one who killed her. hector is livid and demands to know what she is planning to blackmail taylor with. taylor finally admits that shane was there the night of the accident but he didn't say a word. but he was there and saw everything. baker drops by stephanie's and she slams the door in his face and doesn't want him there stirring up things. eric wonders why she is so annoyed that the police are still looking for daren's killer? she explains that thorne has moved on with his life and she does not want him to be reminded of daren. thorne returns home and reflects on his dinner with taylor and how special it was.
stephanie tells her family that this may surprise them, but recent events have given her a new perspective on things and she wants to share this with them. they have had some difficult times in the past few months, but she is sure there will be more difficult times ahead, but not today. today is a celebration of her life. she remembers a request that was always asked of her by her grandchildren and children, and she always said no, but today she is tired of saying no. there is a knock on the door and she tells thomas to go get the front door as fast as he can. it's stephanie, she is going to be so surprised. she tells eric that she is so happy she can still surprise him after all these years. she can't take credit, but it was ridge's idea. he made one of those crazy blueprints he used to do. pam tells her that she really needs to try it ; it will make her feel like a kid again. the entire living room is a slide with everyone skating down the stairs. liam tells brooke that he hates what his dad did to bridget and turning her baby into a scandal. if he had known there was a plan, he would have told someone. aggie tells nick that he has a beautiful smile and he brings it out in her. he laments that he's been taking a beating the last couple of months. he missed his own fashion preview. his mother didn't even miss him ; she was too busy looking at the statue. she laments to him that sometimes you have to laugh or you will cry. she knows what it is like to come back to the land of the living. she asks if he is
wyatt tells hope that he still can't believe ricardo is letting them take the diamond back with them. if he was so convincing then she would not be marrying his brother. she says she will just have to wait until forrester. pam tells donna and caroline that hope and wyatt are on their way back from mexico right now but there is a third passenger  a famous mexican chef and hope and liam are planning a secret wedding fiesta. eric tells quinn that hope is engaged to another man but now there is nothing standing in their way. the diamond can give hope for the future such international press. it would be so rare that most people think it doesn't exist but here it is. hope tells liam that she loved the video and she has a meeting but she will see him as soon as she is done. quinn tells pam and donna that the diamond was mined centuries ago and is held in private collections. most don't know it exists but it is coveted among gemologists like herself. it's supposed to have the opposite effect  good luck in love, especially in love with someone you are already in. rick tells eric that he was not sold on tying the diamond to their collection but he was right, this is not just any diamond.
hope tells steffy that she is lying. liam didn't give her that ring. she walked in here and saw it on the mantel. how did it end up on the mantle if hope had let liam go and he had proposed. she doesn't believe her. she says it would be really foolish of her to tell a lie like that. she suggests that hope ask liam himself. hope says she will. taylor tells brooke that she asked the same questions as any mother would. she heard the ring and it seemed very clear they were doing this. brooke realizes that hope knows she made a terrible mistake. she went there to surprise liam, but it was too late. steffie was still there that morning. bill asks the photographer where he has been. he's been trying to reach liam. his son needs to talk to him so go take a picture instead of micromanage everything. he wants to know how much the party cost. he needs to pay bill back as it was a waste of money. he tells bill that he is still engaged, just not to hope. he found her engagement ring on the fireplace mantel and she was there, but she never said why she wanted to marry him. she called him and told him she never intended to see him again. bill says he has a policy against jumping to conclusions, but he 'd like liam to walk him down this yellow brick road. he says he broke it off with hope and he is not sure he understands it all himself. he was so exhausted from all the waiting and the hoping that he thought he did not have it in him to do this again. all he wanted was the ordinary things  a real home, someone
katie and wyatt run into eric at the forrester mansion. he asks what is new with them. sheila tells mateo that she has a little job for him if he 'd like to come on in. she can make a lot of money if he is interested. it would have to be nights or weekends since he is now the estate manager. she tells him not to let quinn know that she is here as she does not like her at all. quinn catches up with mateo and asks about his promotion and if he told his girlfriend. he says they are not together anymore. he just could not find the right woman. she says he is a handsome man and she is sure some lucky lady will find him irresistible. and she notices how much he cares about this estate as much as they do. he tells her anything she needs, he will let her know. eric tells katie that he did not mean to interrupt them but he is not judging them. they sort of make sense to him. she asks if he has told his father yet. he laughs that is putting it lightly. they do not really want anyone else to know about this but especially his mother. he wants to be the one to tell her if and when it is appropriate. he knows she is his wife but he doesn't know if he can live with that. mateo tells quinn that he should get back to work as there is a couple of companies coming over to clear the brush on the hillside. when sheila says she is going upstairs to do some work when she bumps into him and falls. he checks to see if she is okay. she is but she says it is very important that they keep this just between them.
brooke demands that nick tell her that bridget is pregnant with his child. he begs her to give him a chance to explain. she lashes out at him and tells him that he makes her sick! he tells her that he slept with bridget and she is pregnant. she tries to blame it all on her, but he says it is all his fault and he hates what it is doing to her and to bridget. she says he betrayed them and poisoned their marriage. she wants him out of her house and away from her children. bridget has an ultrasound and is told that she is nine weeks pregnant. the doctor says she is looking at the same thing she is, the baby is nick's.
steffy reads the description of aspen to liam. she says she has skied here so many times, but it's like she is seeing it for the first time. brooke and hope tell taylor and rick that steffy and liam are engaged. hope tells them that she has to find him. she needs to explain to him. taylor explains that hope was trying to talk to bill and get him to tell her where they were going, but he wouldn't do it. rick uses his computer skills to track the tail number of the spencer jet and finds out they are headed to aspen. katie tells bill that hope is going to set the record straight as soon as she finds liam and tell him that she loves him too much to give up on him. bill says if liam wants to contact hope, he can. he doesn't think that will happen. it wasn't until hope ended liam's engagement to his son the other night that was the final straw. she wants to know how steffie got to be at the bachelor party and why bill is keeping hope andliam apart. he says he loves his son and he wants him to be happy so whatever he did, he did for him. he thinks her perspective is a little skewed. hope is his niece so of course she has a soft spot for her. she's her family and she can't stand the thought of steffys with liam, but this is not going to last. hope had her chance, but other priorities got in the way and she blew it. he tells her that liam is finally getting what he needs. he knows people will take issue, but they will come around
quinn tells hope that she is so paranoid. this baby is her blood and she would never do anything to hurt it. hope says she does not trust quinn and neither does wyatt so she is going to have to say this one more time that quinn has to leave. they are done with her and she is not welcome in this home. quinn says like hell she is. she will not let hope keep her from her son and grandchild. so hope needs to change her tune quickly as things are going to get ugly. ivy tells liam that it is a double win for quinn now that hope is expecting a baby. liam says she is a nightmare but he doesn't think she will hurt hope as she would not ever forgive her. perhaps now that she has gotten what she has always wanted she won't be a danger to hope anymore. aly and oliver tell john and pam that liam and ivy are still in that getting to know you stage but it is going very well. pam says yes but liam is really nothing like his dad or w yatt. charlie says now there is a guy you want to watch out for. his wacky mother. john asks eric just how serious is his relationship with ivy. eric says it is still pretty new. john tells him to give him the real scoop. weddings are not cheap and he's lost his daughter. he asks aly if she has seen her. she says she thinks she is still out on the terrace with prince william. hope tells quinn that all she tried to do was tell her that she was not comfortable with her around the baby and instead quinn threatens her. wyat comes out and wants
hope can't believe that liam is out there in aspen and she is not with him. rick assures her that they will find him. bill calls steffy and tells her that hope and rick are on their way to aspen. she's determined to get liam back. she tells bill that hope is not a bad person, but she is too immature for marriage. she will not let liam get sucked into this drama. liam tells steffie that he found something so he wants to take her into town. katie and brooke discuss how bill could do this to them. brooke says hope is going to undo it. she and liam are going to get aspen back. othello calls rick and says there is a great deejay concert tonight and he 'd like rick to get him tickets for it, but rick tells him that hope like hope logan is in town and they are engaged. he needs his help to track down liam spencer and get him on the gondola and give him the message don't give up hope at 3 : 00 p.m.. go alone. bill tells justin and oliver that he wants them to keep an eye on liam and hope. she is trying to track him down and mess with his mind. anything they can do to keep that from happening he will appreciate. they are as loyal as they come and will do anything for him.
brooke tells shauna that this is not a warning, but she is ridge's wife and she is telling her to leave her family alone and stay away from her husband. shauna asks who does she think she is, barging in her house and slapping her across the face and giving her orders. brooke says she and ridge are trying to repair the damage from the fultons. ridge has moved in with steffy and he is trying to work things out with thomas. ridge says they all know what thomas did and it was awful but pointing the finger at him is not going to heal this family. thomas is her brother and he loves her and he does not want her to lose him too. they need each other so he would like her to move out of vinny's and move in here with them. she says he knows what she has been through and he can not ask her to forgive thomas now. he says he did not want hope and liam to come here and take the baby so he ran away. but he is here now and they need to come together and help each other. he is asking her to keep an open mind. they were good once and he wants to make it that way again. eric and quinn tell katie that the whole family is pulling for her and she thanks them. bill says wyatt just sent him a text that he and will are back at the beach house. donna and eric ask if she will be put on the transplant list if brooke isn't a match. bill tells her that she will will will be. she feels lucky that she has a family member who is going to be a match and the logan's are survivors
taylor tells brooke that she already asked rick not to rush into anything and that is exactly what he has done. brooke is amazed at taylor for putting her own feelings aside for jack and doing what was best for him. now she wants taylor to do the same for rick. taylor reminds her that rick is a grown man and he can make his own decisions. he's shown that he wants to be a father, but five or ten years from now, is taylor in any condition to be raising another child. she doesn't think so. and this conversation should be happening between rick and taylor, not brooke. she states that she is not going to let brooke come in her house any more and try to tell her how to run her life. this is the last time. eric asks donna why did he have to have this conversation tonight. what was all this business about begging his forgiveness? did she ever care about him at all? did he matter that much to her? she apologizes and says she is hurting him, but it would only be worse if they waited. he tells her that he says end it now. obviously their marriage is over. he was an old fool. he believed in donna when she showed him that he was a prisoner in his own life. he looked for passion in failed marriages, but not with donna. he never thought he would find it with her. she begs him not to ever think that she didn't love him. donna tells pam that she got what she wanted. pam thought she was going to try something sneaky, but donna won't do that. she tells her to go to whatever rock she has been hiding under
stephanie suggests to brooke that she just throw some things in a bag and come over to her house for a few days. she doesn't want her to be alone. brooke says she is hoping she won't be. she just can't believe this is happening. she can not imagine her life without ridge. she tells stephanie that her sisters will take care of her. she will be looking out for bill and katie too as they just had a beautiful baby and they deserve to be happy. she wants to be a part of that new family they are starting so she can help them. bill comes home early and asks how the baby is and if the nurse has come by. he 'd like to give her a shoulder rub. she asks why he's home so early. he says he was at work. she's upset with him for throwing her brother out the window. he tells hope that it wasn't as dramatic as she thinks. he gave rick a little nudge and he tripped. steffy walks in before thomas can say more. hope tells thomas that he needs to rein it in. his first act as ceo was to throw rick out of a window. thomas says he didn't throw him out ; it was an accident. hope is sure that will fly with the press.
steffy tells liam that she can't believe this. she is his wife. he says yeah, she is. she says a lot of things had to come together at just the right time, but yes she proved to him that he matters to her. she was ready to make a commitment and he was too. she couldn't let anything stop it from happening. rick tells brooke that he still hasn't heard from hope. she doesn't want steffy to get hurt, but she thinks this engagement is absolutely ridiculous, talk about a rebound. once hope has a chance to explain everything to liam and tell him that she still loves him and wants to be with him then he will recommit to her, but liam didn't show up. hope tells rick that she wasn't the one that got married ; liam was. she explains that the gondola stopped at the top of the mountain and she was so close, almost there, but then steffie came and she had flowers and a veil. she had to keep pounding on liam's window to make sure he knew she was there. he tells her that it is never too late ; if he loves her it's always too late. she begs him to just take her home ; she has nothing more to say. she asks to call brooke, but before she can, she gets a call from hope's mom. hope fills her in that liam never saw her. he was married right after they got married. brooke tells ridge that all hope wanted was a second to explain, but now she won't be able to do that as he is married. she knows ridge wants hope to be happy, but not
taylor tells dr. higgins that she is afraid of what might happen between ridge and brooke. she reveals that she has been with another man. ridge reads her the riot act. he can't deny that there is a chemistry between them, but he won't act on it. she asks him how he would feel if taylor had chemistry with someone besides him. he scoffs that taylor is a saint, they 'd see pigs fly before she looked at another man! she tells him about the kiss. he's shocked that she kissed hector. stephanie continues to badmouth brooke to her daughter. she tells her that if she doesn't leave nick, she 'll be in bed with her husband by the time bridget delivers her baby. brooke begs her to go be with nick because he is all she has left.
liam tells steffy that they have to tell his dad. he is no good with surprises. he's on his way home now and he 'd like bill to be nice to him on the way home. bill calls and liam says he 'll be there when he gets home. liam tells bill that he doesn't have a fiancée anymore. brooke tells ridge and ridge tells hope that hope has been in her room all day. she didn't turn down her lunch. she's still devastated over the wedding and she is not ready to talk about it with katie yet. she just wishes she would call her back. ridge and brooke ask hope if she ever found out about the problems with the lift. she says no, but she did not think it important enough to ask liam about it. ridge says they are not sure what they can do for her since he came home early from work and just went straight to bed. eric brings stephanie home and they have dinner in his old study. he says talking across that old table in there is like talking across a football field. they are celebrating the call from dr. lewis that there are no tumors in his brain. she asks why they are eating in there and not in the dining room. he tells her that he wants their lives back. how many good years do he have left. he wants to have his wife back. the pilot tells the couple to keep their seat belts on until they finish taxiing. he asks if there is anyone they want to call, her parents or liam. steffie says she figures if they were worried they would be calling her. she tells liam there will be people out there who will not
zende tells nicole not to over think it, do not do it. tell maya she can't. she says she owes her that much to maya. she told him what she was like when she first came to l.a. and she is just glad he did not see her then. he says they all have to think of themselves. he thinks they could be amazing and people could look at them and say they wish that was them. maya tells rick that she thinks she has been a little short sighted. when you want something your whole life and you never believe you can get it and then suddenly it is right in front of you, then you can lose that perspective. the way nicole looked at zende, she says nicole is pressuring nicole. wyatt tells ivy that she is becoming more and more uninhibited with every passing moment and he is great at behavior mod. she reminds him that parading around the house in her underwear with her boyfriend is different from paraded around in the whole room with a whole bunch of people. liam and katie are having dinner with bill and steffy and he says sure ivy can have her job back as long as she leaves her clothes at the door. bill asks liam what is the matter ; he still has feelings for ivy? liam says she is not a new hire. she is a forrester and a designer and he thought it was very nice of steffie to offer her this opportunity. bill laughs and says what is so uptight about this. he tells liam that if he doesn't want to be looked at, then he is not going to get anywhere in this life. he even brings up emily dick
nick vents to jackie about stephanie's visit and her telling him everything. he berates himself for what he and brooke did to bridget and wonders what kind of person he is. jackie begs him not to do this to himself, not to wallow in the pain he is in. eric is planning a very special evening for jackie, complete with champagne and fine dining, when he calls her to ask her to marry him. she is delighted, but wonders what he wants to talk to her about. she knows he is not nick's father, but she thinks she and eric could have a wonderful life together and asks if it is too much to ask? he gives his blessing and tells her to go find brooke and talk to each other, talk to their feelings, and be what they both deserve. don't let him slip it through his fingers again! eric leaves the office and jackie goes straight to eric's office to find out what he is up to. she finds a receipt for two wedding bands he bought for her and starts babbling on and on about how he is going to propose to her and she will be mrs. eric forrester. she shows her what she took off of his desk  the receipt for the wedding bands. she tells eric she can not marry someone while they are still married to someone else. he tells her it is easily rectified. he has her power of attorney and a lawyer and she can marry him without her consent. she grabs her purse and shows him the receipt.
steffy tells hope that she doesn't know what she is doing here. hope tells her that she needs to see liam right now. steffy says no, hope can't come in as it is a private party. hope says she knows they got married and she thinks she knows that she knows. she knows she went to aspen, but she is going to tell liam. he has a right to know. she says she saw it all while she was stuck in the gondola ; the impromptu marriage. there are no do - overs ; they are married now. there is nothing she can say to change that. there's nothing hope can accept ; she will have to respect that. she wants to know why it matters if liam knows she was in aspen. she thinks it might make him wonder why she was there if she broke up with him. maybe she had second thoughts, but it was too late. she was ready to move in with liam and give herself to him completely. she realizes that was her big mistake, but they could have gotten past all of that with time. brooke tells donna that she drove hope over to liam's and she is not sure it is too late, but maybe if she explains everything to him then she will get him back. katie tells bill that she still has a lot of questions about this marriage. she wishes she could be happy about this. it's a travesty. ridge admits he is a little uneasy about supporting this marriage, but liam is a good guy and he trusts them to know what they are doing. she's just curious as to why he is embracing this marriage with such open arms. liam thanks ridge
stephanie tells brooke that she is having a party to celebrate her life and she wants brooke to be part of it. brooke doesn't understand why things can't stay the way they were with her, ridge, eric and stephanie. she will be there for her, but she's not going to act like this is a good thing or make something positive out of this. in order to survive, brooke has to be strong. she needs strength in her life right now and she needs her to be her strength. she cries that she will come through for her ; she will. donna thanks thomas for calling forrester and thanks him for the office supplies and pam's recipe for lemon bars. he's in the office with eric, but donna stops him and asks him not to interrupt. eric breaks the news to pam that his wonderful steph is dying. he tells donna that he knows caroline knows he has a lot in store for her and she 'll come back to him. there's no way he is going to let his father down now. he can make the rest of her life happy and joyous. that's why he wants to give this party. they won't run from what is happening, but use it to make it a wonderful place for steph. pam isn't sure she is as strong as brooke, but eric thinks she can do it.
taylor tells thorne that she knows he still hates her, but in time he will forget about her. time won't heal this wound or undo what she did. but she will pay for it when she is sentenced. he laments ten years. what is that to a little girl who will be without her mother for the rest of her life? phoebe tells thomas that his mother hit darla and covered up. there was nothing his mother could do. no one thinks she did it on purpose, so why is she going to jail? brooke assures her that her father has hired a good lawyer and he will do everything he can for her. shane reminds stephanie that she told him there would be no court in the country that would believe him, that he would have nothing to gain out of that, so he should just keep his mouth shut. she urges him that taylor needs his help now. he has to tell the judge, they need a cooperating witness. he reminds her that he is out of work, he is a petty thief and she didn't say he shouldn't even get close to a court room. the assistant d.a. assures brooke and storm that she is going to make sure taylor gets a few minutes alone with her family before the sentencing. thomas comes in and asks if taylor is okay. ridge tells him the best thing they can do right now is be there for her and let her know they are all behind her 100 %.

ridge tells brooke that this office used to feel more like home to him than his actual home, but now it feels like a prison. all he has to do is outlive bill spencer. things will change ; this will too. he apologizes for walking out on her earlier. a mistake has been made and she needs bill's help to correct it. ridge can not continue to work here ; he can retire. he can and he will. he will file an injunction to enforce the non - compete clause. brooke begs katie to give him a little time ; he will come around. she made a mistake ; she thought it would be easier if they just sold the company. she admits she talked to her accountant and had him make up a financial statement with all the details. she wants to give her husband back his work, his life, his dream. she knows it is not quite as much as bill paid for forrester creations, but she can loan him the rest of her holdings. everything she owns can be liquidated by the end of the week. he 'll have a wonderful future with her sister. she just needs him to talk to the bank and get them to reinstate the 9-year note that they took away from them and then they will be able to manage everything. stephanie is suspicious when pam tells her that she is today's guest on the catwalk. perhaps she should change. donna tells justin not to tell her who the first guest is as she 'd rather just be surprised.

bill tells brooke that katie is playing dirty. his house, his jet, his yacht, his company, that is bad enough but shutting him out of his son's life is too dangerous for her to go down. brooke says she is just hurt and lashing out but maybe now she will change her mind. she knows being patient is not bill's strong suit but if he can just relax and give it a little more time and k atie will come around. they will all be one big happy family. he says he is not oblivious to what this `` us `` is costing her. she says it has been a challenge but it would be unthinkable for her not to be with him. she tells him that rj is only 15 minutes away and his mother is making him miserable by keeping him from him. he wonders how he is going to put up with this for a year or two years until he is old enough to make his own decision. he tells her that he will never lose sight of what she means to him. his love for her is solid and sure and constant. she asks what's wrong? he says she did not hear a bear so he will go check. charlie tells wyatt that a good jewel thief can waltz in and waltzed out before you even know what hits you. he needs someone like him who knows all the angles. he fills him in on the hague jewel heists and how clever these thieves can be. he could be talking to a soccer mom or a guy in drag, but he needs to get back to work. he shows up at ricardo's and quinn tells him she never gets tired of looking at this diamond. she wishes they could keep it.
brooke tells ridge that the hospital is releasing bill today. she is glad he is okay and she is grateful that ridge did not press charges against him and thorne and he should be too. ridge says there was no reason to have thorne arrested. thorne threw the first punch and bill threw back. she spent quite a bit of time in bill's hospital room and he wants to know what he said to her. pam tells charlie that the old quinn is coming back and it is heartless. the forrester's have been so good to her and she could totally rely on them when she lost her mother and then steph. he 'd really like to hear about it if she wants to tell him. quinn tells eric that she knows how much stephanie's portrait means to him and she holds it in the highest regard. it was a freak accident and she feels badly about it. she hopes he believes her. he says he does. he just wishes she could be a little more patient and understanding where pam is concerned. she says she knows pam means a lot to him but she hates her and disrespects her every single time she gets. and now he wants her to open her home to pam and not just to get married here but to usurp her position in this household. yes she used to be the matriarch but that is her title now. and for pam to ask eric to take the portrait down is so disrespectful. eric says it is only for a few hours and pam wants to have this wedding here and they can just give her that. she does not want to fight with him but if it is so important to him then he can have pam get
bridget tells brooke that taylor is having trouble going home without her baby. she can't blame her entirely ; she handled the procedure and the baby ended up with brooke's dna. and now she is finding out that brooke is jack's biological mother, but that doesn't have to change anything for any of them. nick and taylor are welcomed home from the hospital by thomas, jackie and phoebe. thomas wants to know more about the donor and nick explains that she wasn't what taylor expected, but she was a good person. taylor tells them to stay as she just wants to lay down by herself. bridget urges brooke to sign the papers relinquishing her parental rights. clarke tells cj that sally is selling the business to jackie m. and he will be right back with the buyer. ridge tells felicia that he has been dealing with something ; it's taylor's baby. he fills her in on the details. brooke logan is the biological mother. she donated her eggs, but the lab made a big mistake. she is making no claims on the baby. once the baby is well, taylor and nick can get on with their lives. felicia questions him if taylor can really handle raising brooke and nick's child.
brooke tells bill that katie has a point. she doesn't want her son to end up without a father. bill says she has no problem making him jump through hoops when he wants to see him. brooke tells him the mountain will be there for them any other day. he says if she thinks she is going to cut him out of his holidays too, forget it. she tells him he is about to do a very dangerous climb so he needs to focus. hope tells wyatt that it is really a shame they have to close early today. she can't believe her mom is going mountain climbing with her dad. charlie tells hope that he has three eyes  two on the diamond and one on the door. nothing gets past him. ria comes in and wants to help hope with the gift baskets but hope tells her to send them to her mom's place. she 'd like them to stay here at forrester's. she says all of this publicity is because of him and that diamond. he tells her she is a role model for young girls everywhere and she should be proud of herself. he's glad to have her on watch. bill checks with brooke to make sure she is ready for this. she assures him she is. it is a high climb but she is up for it. if not, then they will see her back at base camp. she really thinks she can handle this.
ridge tells eric that his mother has been through enough and doesn't deserve this treatment from him or jackie. she did not deserve this. eric says jackie is his friend and he had no right to come barging into her house like this. ridge says he is not the one in the wrong here ; eric is. he walked out on his mother and then came running over here looking for sympathy. ridge tells him that he degraded everything he and his mother have built together with family, loyalty, devotion and he is going back to his mother right now. he vows that he will never let him do that again. thomas shows oliver and thomas some of the blogs about hope and her line on the internet. it's unbelievable. hope tells brooke and katie that she still believes in her message, but she still lost liam because he let steffy get too close to him. she over - reacted and paid the price. she's not the other woman anymore ; she is his wife. hope admits that she hasn't been sleeping well and she feels trapped, like she can't breathe. she wants to go back to work and to promote her line, but right now she is stuck. everything is such a mess. brooke wants to see her eat ; she has to have something to eat. hope assures her that she is not falling apart. she does not need to be pacing her room all night. they tell her that donna is not pressing her ear against hope's door, but thomas walks in and says he has something to tell her. he's glad she is still there ; there is something she needs to see.
liam tells hope that kelly fell asleep at steffy's and he thought it would be a good idea to get the girls together. then he asks about her party with douglas. she says he was the cutest little dalmatian ever and he was glad to see her. he asks if she is still trying to get thomas to give her custody of douglas ; somehow douglas has to be freed from thomas. thomas tells zoe that living with ridge and eric has brought him closer to hope ; she sees him trying to put his life back together and be the man she can see herself with. he will not be completely satisfied until he gets hope back in his life. zoe says she is more than disappointed. he was so focused on his designs and now he is daydreaming about hope again. he says she came to his grandfather's party and they were able to talk for a little while. she tells him he should be focusing on his career and she will help him with hers. hope tells liam that ridge has convinced everyone to ignore thomas's worst behavior but they haven't seen it. she is asking him to just trust her and let the forrester's figure this out. liam says douglas needs her, but thomas is still the primary caregiver. he does not trust him either so they should leave it to the forresters. bill drops by and liam tells him how well katie is doing. bill sees the look hope gave him and wants to know what is going on. hope says it was too late to talk last night ; she has to go to brooke's. brooke tells her that she is glad she got home safe and thanks
brooke tells bill that he is so quiet. he says just thinking about everything. she says he is okay and all that matters is that she still has him. he grabs her hand and says this is just what he needed to set his mind straight and let's go. she asks if he is all right. he replies that yes, he is a survivor and he is not going to let a mountain or anyone get the best of him. she tells him not to be so hard on himself. they are both okay and it will be a great story to tell will someday. she thanks him for hanging from the side of the mountain and for wearing his harness. and she doesn't know what she would have done if she had lost bill. he's sorry to put her through this. she can only imagine how this experience must have felt to him. bill says life changing. caroline walks in and is surprised to see martha there. carter tells maya that it is good to be back in the office. he missed her. she too misses working for hope for the future. in her dream world she would like to have her job back. he knows this has nothing to do with rick and she says yes. she is completely and totally over rick forrester and totally committed to carter. everything turned out the way it was meant to. rick tells caroline that hope and wyatt have it all under control and they need to start planning their wedding. she wants to make it up to him, but he says yes just like he said. he would marry her anywhere. she quips the most dangerous thing she ever wants him to do is carry her over the threshold on their wedding night.
rick tells hope and ivy that thorne already has a team in amsterdam and he wants them to hit the ground running as they have a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time. communication is key. he will not be there this time. he tells carter and maya that it is still the same game plan. amsterdam is already in love with ivy's jewelry and it is the perfect time for them to launch. ivy gets a text from liam. she says she is sorry about all the exclamation points but she was worried he wasn't going to make it. he says he can not leave without saying goodbye. she tells him that she wants him to come with her to amsterdam. he doesn't think this is a good idea. he's going to be really busy with the launch and she is sure he won't have time to pack. she offers that he could even cover the launch for the magazine and she could even hook him up with an interview with the head jewelry designer. but rick has to stay behind as he is the new ceo so it will be just ivy and wyatt. ridge walks in and rick tells ridge and caroline that there is no reason for him to be here. hope will be handling the shoot and that is all ridge needs to know. caroline begs him not to do this. they need to be able to work together. rick says they have to finish the meeting and he will need them to leave. wy tells hope that caroline made a good point and she knows this will be hard on hope but she knows rick will be focused on the photo shoot and she should too. he trusts all of them. he is not going
caroline asks ridge how did she get so lucky to have a man so good. he says just a man who loves his wife. that is all he needs to know. steffy thanks thomas again for helping ivy and says she can't stop thinking about what could have happened. thomas says if there is one thing he is good at it is pulling women out of the way of falling objects. he is the guy you want around during meteor showers and snowshowers. he also wants her to be careful of being involved with a spencer. she asks if he is going to save her from wyatt too when he is through saving her from thomas. he tells her some people are beyond help. she says that is funny but she still has a chance to see the light. ivy tells thomas that she will leave them to rash it out. she leaves them alone to talk. he stops her and says no, don't go. it is not about that ; it is about his taste in women. she tells him that he has made some bad decisions in the past and he should not make another one like that with ivy. caroline and ridge arrive at the hospital for their first ultrasound. he asks if it is okay that his papa came too. dr. li says yes, it is always good to see him. she wants to know how is the morning sickness and if caroline has been going to the grocery store. ridge says not yet but she better get on with that now and get the baby to start working too as that is the hard part of growing his baby. pam shows kristina some chocolate mousse pie recipes and tells her the interns do n not have the best eyesight so she
thomas tells liam that he needs to be home with his wife, his sister. hope is not his anymore so let her go. he's married to steffy now so give her some space and let her get over liam and move on. liam is surprised to hear that thomas thinks he is good for hope. she is a strong, dynamic woman and he is not making it any easier for her. this is not high school and it's time for these games to end. he reminds thomas that his sister did the right thing. she stopped the gondola and she kept hope from getting to him. he knows his sister better than anyone else on this planet and she must feel horrible for lying to him, but it is in the past. now he has a beautiful wife at home and he can visit her any time he wants to. but do not come back here looking for hope ; go live his life and let hope live hers. amber finds rick hanging out in his old office. she tells him that he has some pull around here so maybe he should take it back. it would be nice to have a lot of good memories in here. she shows him some sketches and she thinks he might be on to something. she knows his secret  his man bag. she picks it up for him the other day and he tells her that it is not a man bag, just a very masculine manly bag and she can't help but take a little peek. she's speechless when he shows her the designs. she says he really has something with this line and he just needs to believe in himself as much as she does.
wyatt tells lars that liam is into ivy, he just needs that extra little push. he wants it to be romantic on the canal in that beauty. he does not want anyone to know about their arrangement, not even hope. deacon tells quinn that he wants his daughter to be happy. she says she is happy. her son makes her very happy. he says he knows and he knows she would like liam and ivy to return from amsterdam all hot and heavy but she does not believe that is going to happen. but if wyatt can create the right ambiance then maybe they can get past the hand holding stage. he tells her that he thinks she needs to stay out of it. just focus on other things. she wants to know if one of those other things might be taking a trip. he suggests amsterdam. she laments that europe is beautiful this time of year. she will book them on the next flight and they will be in amsterdam right away. he warns her that is a bad idea. he shows her and tells her if she needs another reminder, take a look at her grandchild, that is her grandbaby. eva arrives at the airport for the photo shoot. she introduces hope to ivy and liam. she tells hope that she could not have told her that she was running off to monte carlo to get married. she is just doing her job. hope asks if she is suggesting that ivy model too. she can not believe she is asking her to model. she has avoided the public spotlight for years so why not now. it is time for her to put herself out there and get in front of the camera. wy says he will think about it and get
stephanie visited sally to discuss her behavior at jackie and massimo's wedding. stephanie told sally she was worried about her. sally told her she was going to be a grandmother again. jackie asked nick how brooke was taking the news of his one night stand. nick told her about the encounter with brooke. he wondered if there was a way to find out if she was carrying his child. ridge told a reporter to run the story about him and brooke having a baby. samantha dropped by the office with a gift for the baby if it's a boy. ridge was glad she told him how she felt. they discussed her wanting to settle down someday. he suggested he might know the perfect guy. she said he wasn't talking about that brother of his, thorne. he said nick was a free agent with no strings attached. darla and sally waited for the doctor, who was sally's friend, sally spectra. when the doctor came in, she was surprised to meet jackie's son, nick. the doctor told nick and jackie about the paternity test.
katie is ecstatic on her wedding day. she tells brooke and donna that she thinks bill will be knocked out when he sees his gorgeous bride. katie tells bill that it's too late to change his mind, but she wants the wedding in the park. the next time they see her, she will be saying `` i do. `` stephen takes beth to the park where they used to hang the girls'bathing suits on the railing and hang them to dry after a hot summer day. ridge is surprised to find karen is also there. she says she couldn't very well be a no - show. she is quite surprised that her jet - setting brother is getting marred in a park in van nuys, but bill agreed. this must really be love. karen quips to ridge that this is not quite as sophisticated as his yacht, but the logan's are a tight, fierce little group and he should warn him that they are a pretty tight group. once you are part of them, you are one of them for life. he's honored. stephen introduces them to mike and kelly demartin who are neighbors of beth and stephen's from high school. they tell them how glad they are that he and beth are back together. justin tells marcus that he always used to sit on the porch steps and hang his bathing suits there when they were little and thought they 'd be together forever. eric thanks stephanie for coming. he doesn't know what to say to these people. he confides in her that donna is too busy with the new show and justin is marcus's father, so he won't be going to
wyatt tells hope that nothing is going to stop them from doing this photo shoot. ivy will hold her own. hope says she is not a model but she can not stand by and coach her through this whole thing. wyatt says this is huge. the international press is everywhere and she needs to be focused. and liam needs to get on with his life. liam and ivy wake up in holland. she says they both know that hope's problems go way beyond modeling. she is married to w yatt and carrying his child. she has to let go of him eventually. eric tells rick that that is fine. he asks taylor how ivy is doing and she says of course her father would be so proud. he says he will have to call rick back as something came up. he tells taylor that he is glad to see her. she asks if she has ever come to l.a. and not stopped to see him. she hears he is no longer ceo and that really surprised her. did he choose rick to take his place? he says not at first but they will talk about that later. she mentions one of her favorite cities and he says yes they are shooting today in amsterdam. hope tells the models to give it a little flare and style as they have to show both the jewelry as well as the accessories. if they are nervous then it probably means they are going to move too fast. so just be aware of that and take a pause and a breath between each pose. hope takes ivy's back and says they can go ahead with hope as ivy has to have a back - up. they have only a limited amount of time there so they need to be tight.
brooke laments to rick that she crafted that speech so perfectly and she wanted the world to know how important ridge was to fc and yet he just walks right out. it doesn't make any sense. she calls katie and asks her to keep jack for a little while longer. something is going on between brooke and ridge and it's not good. stephanie shows up at rick's and he begs her to leave it alone. he has done what she has wanted to do for decades  put a wedge between ridge and brooke. she accuses him of conning everyone  his mother, his father, everyone. she wants to know what else he did and she is sure there is more. he won't tell her, but warns her that if she says a word to anyone about this, they will have yet another of their chaotic cycles. now it is his turn and ridge will never hurt his mother again ; it is not happening. he can have his mother back. there is no such thing as forever with ridge, there is always another woman waiting in the wings. he does not want his mother to go through that again. if this works, his mother will be free of ridge and he will befree of her.

katie tells brooke that she is trying to respect eric's choices, but she is starting to really not like it. he chose quinn whether they like it or not. and now she has to be careful where his loyalties are. brooke asks if something happened. katie says it wasn't specific but it kind of was. she overheard quinn tell liam to enjoy his time with steffy as these days are going to be his last. she plays it for brooke and brooke plays it back and says that sounds like a threat to her. eric is taking a shower in the outdoor shower when he hears a noise in the bushes and quinn hears it too. quinn asks eric not to come any closer as she doesn't want him to ruin the surprise. she turns the shower off and asks ridge to hand her a towel. he comes out and says he came to see his dad and he heard a noise so he thought he might as well check it out. she says he needs to be more careful coming over here unannounced as he never knows what he might walk in on. he tells her to get dressed as he does not want to scare her. she tells him that his lurking got him to see her in the buff. he should be thanking her. he says she is just as scary as she ever was. he wants her to stay away from his dad. ridge says maybe he should scare her so what is all this? she says it is his father's christmas present. he's always wanted an outdoor shower and now he has one. she was just giving it a test run. it is nice and the water is warm so he should try it. she kisses him
liam tells wyatt that he has had that goofy grin on his face ever since he walked in here this morning and he has been majorly distracted. he says he has news but they are not telling anyone yet. it is just that he is his brother and he wants him to know. they are going to have a new spencer into the world. he hopes this does not upset him. he and steffy just found out yesterday during an exam and it is really early so they are keeping it on the dl. katie drops in on brooke and says she is happy for her. she is sure she will see will a lot over the holidays so is there a special reason for this surprise visit. brooke says no, just ridge proposed and she accepted. she says she always thought she and ridge would end up together. but since they are sharing things with each other she can confide in her that she is involved with him now. she tells brooke that she was hesitant to get involved at first because there were a lot of obvious reasons but when she is with him it just feels right. he is a young, hot guy and it sounds like something you might do and have but she just did not understand it before. she doesn't know who else knows. quinn is not thrilled about this but she has agreed not to say anything. liam says they are being cautiously optimistic because there are still so many things out of their control that could go wrong but he is not even thinking about a name yet. they don't even know if it is a boy or girl. but one thing is for certain they will be very lucky to have them as parents and a grandpa as well on the way. ridge tells bill that he
hope tells steffy that she hopes she understands. she just does not feel comfortable with taylor being around anyone she cares about, let alone their daughters. she and her mother have every reason to be concerned and she is not going to change her mind. reese tells brooke that he was just walking by and he heard her refer to taylor as dr. hayes and he can not let her treat her that way. he tells her that she does not deserve to be treated like this. she is a kind, caring, principled woman and he is making it his business now. he is not privy to the whole backstory but he knows enough to know that brooke is trying to drive a wedge between taylor and her granddaughter. there is no excuse for her to treat her like that. brooke says he does not know the backstory but if he did he would understand she is only looking out for kelly's best interest. he asks her how she can even say that. both she and hope married the most important man in her life and yet she is married to two different men. they have a highly complex history that he can't even begin to understand but she is compelled to help taylor in any way she can. he says he is there to help her any way he can. xander tells zoe that her dad was a bit of a player but he never had any regard for her or how that would affect her. maya walks in and xander is glad to see her. she says she thought she might find him back here. she asks about emma and he says they went through some things but they have put that all behind them. emma broke it off with him as they were in different places in their

gwen and fox are on their way back to harmony, having managed to elude the fact that ethan and theresa are still tied up in a tug - of - war over theresa's baby. gwen has managed to convince theresa that she and ethan can take the baby and raise her as their own now that theresa has signed away her rights to her, thanks to katherine, but theresa is still adamant that gwen can not take her baby from her. she will not let gwen take her daughter from her, and she will make sure of it. katherine tries to talk her out of it, but she won't be deterred. fox, ethan, and katherine head back to the plane, leaving theresa and the baby to talk about what's going on. meanwhile, whitney and simone argue about why she gave her baby up for adoption, with simone telling her that she's just as bad as their mother for doing it. whitney says she wants her baby to have a fresh start without all the family's secrets, but simone points out that that could happen to any other children she has, like her own. she could end up married to her cousin's first cousin without them knowing it, and they could commit incest. she doesn't think whitney should give her baby away to anyone, but whitney isn't so sure that's what she wants. simone leaves them alone to talk, and when she comes back julian and eve have arrived at the adoption agency and are ready to fill out the papers to adopt baby russell. liz, tc, and george are also at the agency, and tc and liz

theresa, ethan, and gwen are back in harmony and back at the mansion. fox is nowhere to be found, of course, and theresa is sure that once gwen is back in jail, she 'll be able to lure ethan back to her, and they 'll all be a family again. however, as soon as theresa and ethan are alone on the plane, they each tell the other what they want to hear, and it's not good. fox wants to go home and meet his son, but theresa tells him he has to wait until tomorrow, when gwen goes back to jail, and he won't be around to see his son. meanwhile, rebecca is on the phone with gwen, informing her she's a changed woman, that she has ethan now, and that she plans on making theresa pay for what she did to theresa. gwen doesn't seem to be too worried about that, but rebecca does, and is determined to make sure theresa pays for her crimes.
miguel tells kay that he wants her to go to fox and tell him that she wants to be with him forever, but she refuses. he begs her to do this for him, so she goes to fox. fancy and luis are escorted back to their respective cells after their visit with each other, and he is put with harry, the other murderer, who has been moved to a separate cell. fancy is put back on the visitors list, and she and sheridan try to convince him to let her come see him, but he won't hear of it. sheridan blames fancy for this, of course, and says she will never be able to come back to work because she can't stand to be near him. fancy says she isn't going to give up her badge, but all she can think about is being at the police station with lu is being raped by the man she loves, and there is no way to get him out of her mind. ethan tries to find theresa, who is locked in a secret room where she had escaped from alistair's hideaway. he finds a large knife and tries to cut her free, but the person laughs at him and tells him he has nothing to do with her since no one wants him. he tells her she disobeyed him and will pay for that, and so will ethan. she begs him to help her get her brothers out of jail, saying she will do anything to help them. he laughs and says he is going to crush ethan to make him jelly, and tells her that she can spread ethan on her toast for breakfast. she runs out of the room, and ethan calls out to her from the other side of the wall
gwen and ethan continue to argue over theresa's case and whether or not she will be able to give birth to their child. gwen is convinced the judge will rule in their favor, while theresa is convinced that he will rule against her, as he already has when he let them adopt little ethan. whitney and chad make love, and she tells him that nothing can ever come between them, not even her mother, and he vows that nothing will ever tear them apart. however, there is a change in judge reilly's health, and judge ellis has taken ill, so a new judge has been assigned to the case. this gives theresa a better chance of getting her son back. pilar and eve have a heart - to - heart about julian and their son, and pilar realizes that eve is caught between a rock and a hard place, loving both men. she tells her to be careful not to let either one of them destroy her relationship with chad. sam tells alistair he needs to make an appointment to talk to him about his arrest. luis shows sheridan the cd - roms and shows her the proof he has on the cd's to prove that antonio brainwashed her in the psych ward and tried to kill her, and had her forget about her father. he shows her more proof, but she still doesn't want to believe him. he tries to convince her that he is only trying to upset her and that she is in love with him. sheridan wants to confront her father and find out the truth, so she goes to see him.
luis has the proof he needs to bring the cranes down, and he's ready to show it to sam and the feds. sam will arrest julian and alistair as soon as he has it, and then the feds will take it from there. luis is thrilled, but beth is upset that she hasn't been able to stop him yet, since she knows that once the cd - roms are released, everyone will hate her and she 'll never get sheridan back. antonio tries to talk her out of it, but she insists that she needs to see the proof for herself. pilar and theresa talk about theresa's plan to get ethan to sleep with her so that she can get pregnant again, and no one will ever know she lost the baby. she calls a friend of hers who used to work for crane industries and has set up a fake interview for gwen for the next day, so that theresa will have to leave town and gwen will have no reason to stay in town. she is thrilled about that, but gwen isn't so happy about it, either.
the founder's day dance is underway, with luis and the cops all set up around the ballroom. however, alistair and julian show up at the last minute, interrupting the fun for rebecca, who's trying to stay away from the dance because she's afraid of what's going to happen. pilar is against theresa's plan, but theresa is convinced it's the only way to get little ethan back. she goes to pilar for the keys to the crane mansion, and pilar gives her the key and the code, so theresa sneaks into the mansion and tries to seduce ethan, who thinks he's with gwen, but is really with theresa.
chad, fancy, luis, noah, paloma, simone, jessica, and simone are still trapped in the catacombs, but the collapse has allowed them to escape. chad is worried about whitney, who is still being held captive by the executioner. she is convinced she has to die with chad to save his life, but as they leave to go to the lord's house to pray for each other, she is killed. paloma is still in rome, however, with simone and her friend simone's help, and she seems to be getting in way over her head. she hasn't been to an art school they know about, and the crane european security man tells theresa that her sister paloma has disappeared. jerry, theresa's agent, tells her that crane security has been contacted and they have tried to contact her brother, but he seems to have disappeared as well. she tells jerry that she will be going to rome alone, but jerry warns her that could be a trap, and that she needs to have a man with her there to protect her. ethan and gwen are still arguing about theresa, but they finally agree that she is a tiresome b * tch and will never change, but it doesn't seem to bother them at all.
pilar's family gathers at the hospital as theresa, miguel, theresa and antonio say a tearful good - bye to her. eve realizes that julian's blood type is so rare that perhaps one of their children could be the one who donated it, so she goes to the hospital to check it out. she is shocked to learn that it could be their son, fox. pilar is fading fast and eve has to go back to the chapel to give her the last dose of the experimental drug. luis and sheridan continue their reunion in the chapel as he professes his love for her, but she tells him that she loves her husband and they are going to stay married. ivy tries to get sam to choose between her and grace, but he can't decide which one he wants to be with. paloma is out having a good time at the founder's day dance when she gets a call from her mother in harmony, telling her that something is wrong with her and that she needs to come home right away. she decides to leave and goes straight to the park where she bumps into paloma's friend paloma - in - law, paloma who runs off to go clubbing. sam and ivy argue about whether grace still loves him or not, but then they make love.
whitney tells pilar that she and chad are going to have another baby. paloma is happy for them, but wonders where theresa is. whitney tells her that she is with jared, who is still on the terrace. julian tells kay that he can get miguel out of prison if she gives up fox. kay tells him that she loves fox and won't leave him. he tells her he will do anything to keep that lie alive. fox hears his father's voice in his head and tells kay not to over - do it, but she goes ahead anyway. she tells him she can not be with another man if she can't be with miguel. she says fox only wants her to be happy and if he knew she was in love with someone else he would let her go. he says no, he will not allow that. the blackmailer sees ethan and theresa kissing. he goes to theresa's room and finds her there. she is scared, but he calms her down and tells her not to think about jared now. he leaves and she starts to cry. he comes back in and says he is glad ethan is being a good boy and staying away from that bitch theresa. he thinks he will reward him for his good behavior. ethan tells theresa that he doesn't want her to ever say jared's name again. theresa tells him not to say it and he agrees. they make love.
endora's `` party `` at tabitha's house was interrupted by the arrival of two mothers of `` teenagers `` who had come to visit. they were shocked to see the `` beach party `` was really a party for teenagers, with mickey, maria, susie, and mickey drinking beer. tabby told endora to make the girls go back to their normal sizes before their mothers figure out they are witches. endora tried to make them think they were teenagers again, but they weren't buying it. miguel told kay that she had to tell fox the truth about them so they could be together. she tried to talk him out of it, but he didn't want her to do it on her own. he wants her to tell him now that he is free, so they can be together as a family. kay told him that she will tell him tonight. julian told fox that he had held up his end of the bargain, so now it's kay's turn to hold up her end and tell miguel she won't be seeing him again. fox is happy that miguel is finally free, but still guilty about what he and miguel did to fox. pilar is happy for miguel, too, but she worries about what will happen to luis now that the truth will come out about him.
whitney again lectured theresa about her scheming ways, and this time theresa told her that when they made love, all she was thinking about was getting pregnant so she could have a baby to give to ethan and gwen, in exchange for her getting her son back. whitney still can't figure out why theresa is doing this, and theresa explains that it's the only way she can get little ethan back, since gwen and ethan have adopted him and she is the only one with the chance to do so. she will do anything to get him back, whitney tells her, but theresa won't hear of it. luis took sheridan home from the hospital, telling her he wasn't going to let her go until she remembers that she loves him, but she told him she doesn't have feelings for him anymore, that she is in love with antonio. alistair, listening in on the conversation, is amused by it all, and tells his henchman that one of them is going to have to die soon, but he has no idea which one it will be. sheridan is still dazed from the drugs dr. ackland gave her in the psych ward, and she hasn't a clue what he's been up to. she does, however, remember that she had a dream that he told her he would kill her if she didn't remember who he really was, so he decides to take her home to spend some time with him, hoping to spark her memory of her love for him. gwen worries about theresa's plans, but rebecca assures her they will bring theresa down once theresa has her baby
kay and miguel have a tender moment, and she reminds him of the times they spent together while she was working on the fishing boat. she then asks him why he is modeling now, and he tells her he's doing it so he can put some of the money into maria's college fund. they kiss again, and when he leaves to go to work, she tells miguel that she doesn't think siren is right for him. he apologizes for thinking she was siren, but says she's no longer a threat to him. meanwhile, in rome, theresa manages to get a hold of jt cornell's answering machine and leaves a message for him, telling him she and gwen are on the way out of rome before he tells ethan and theresa that they are the ones who sent the tabloid the information about ethan's paternity. she calls gwen, who is thrilled to hear from ethan that theresa hasn't called her, but is worried about theresa being with jt, since he is the editor of the tabloid. theresa, however, tells gwen how she and rebecca are going to expose her for what she is - a liar, a schemer, and a homewrecker. gwen tries to tell her she has no proof, but theresa shows her the picture of gwen and joe in bed together, which gwen can't believe she 'd do. she tries to show it to her mother, but gwen won't accept it, but when jt shows up, she grabs the picture and shows it to ethan, who believes it's the proof gwen has been hiding all this time.
noah and paloma tell noah about jessica's johns, and noah is furious with spike for what he's done. the blackmailer tells spike to keep digging and he 'll tell him how many men he killed. theresa and julian continue to argue about little ethan's paternity, and neither one of them is telling the truth. ethan walks in and demands to know what they're talking about, but theresa won't tell him. rebecca continues to search for gwen, and finally gets a clue from grace's diary. she calls gwen and tries to get her to come home, but gwen tells her she has a life of her own and ethan loves her, so she's not coming home. she hangs up on rebecca again. sam gets a letter from scotland yard about grace. in it, they say some of her effects were burned, but not destroyed in the bus explosion. he reads a passage from her diary, where she talks about sam finding out who's responsible and how she needs to get back to harmony to warn the people she loves. he wonders what grace was talking about. paloma tells noah what spike has done to them all. noah can't believe it, but paloma says it's spike's fault.
whitney is upset that she has to help alistair get into the pope's room to retrieve the chalice, but he convinces her that he is doing god's work and not evil, and she agrees to do it. however, when she sees his burned hands, she wants to know why they get burned when he does his evil work. he explains that it is because of his mortal sin, sleeping with her half - brother, and having a child with him. she decides she doesn't want to do that, but then changes her mind after seeing him burn his own hands. noah and ethan continue to argue about luis and fancy, each trying to make the other see the other's side of things, but neither one of them is able to convince the other of what they really see. ethan tries to get noah to go talk to fancy, but noah says he can't, because her life would be over if she knew what he 'd do if she found out. theresa tries to talk fancy out of her plan to lure beth out into the open so someone can catch her and get her to come out so she can save marty, but she is determined to go through with it no matter what theresa says. fancy, of course, is thrilled. miguel, fox, carl, kay, and carl's dad carl have to rescue miguel and siren from the boat in the harbor after carl said she's a mermaid, but when miguel hasn't come up for air in a long enough to save her, kay decides to go in to get him. they find him and bring him out of the water, and s
theresa is still trying to find proof that gwen and rebecca were the ones who sent the information about ethan's paternity to the tabloids, and tabitha is trying to convince her to find it, too. she tells her to be diligent, search and search, and if she finds the proof, all her dreams of being a family with ethan and her son will come true. she finally finds it, but it's only rebecca and gwen that she finds it out from, and it doesn't help her get ethan back. ethan overhears gwen telling rebecca that he misunderstood what he heard, but he still wants to know what is on the disk. rebecca covers by telling him it is just another copy of the pictures from gwen's computer, but she was afraid she would erase the pictures and leave them for gwen to find, and she didn't want her to have any pictures at all of her wedding day. he agrees to make another copy, and they start to make love. meanwhile, back at the mansion, alistair tries to get katherine to move back into the mansion to live with him and keep sheridan's secret, but martin won't have anything to do with that, and tries to talk her out of it. sheridan and beth are still hiding out in the crane mansion, waiting for luis and sheridan to break down the front door and take marty, but beth manages to get the door open just in time, and hides in the closet as they go out the back door. she hears them coming, but they don't see her, so she goes back inside to wait for them to leave. lu
luis and sheridan manage to get the tape recording of mrs. wallace's scream to luis, then take it to the hospital, where they hear beth tell marty she's going to take him to the er and leave sheridan to suffocate in the closet, then leave her there to die. they go find her and lock her up and throw away the key. beth is happy her plan is working like a charm, and marty is safe now, safe from mommy's clutches. meanwhile, sheridan is still trying to find out where beth has taken marty, and she finally finds the closet where the note beth left, but the old woman in there won't tell her, either, since she isn't much of a role model to her little sister, theresa, given the fact she doesn't live at home and has two children out of wedlock. theresa is still determined to find the proof that rebecca and gwen sent the information to the tabloid about ethan being sam's son, so she can get him out of gwen's house and back with her. pilar is upset, of course, but can't do anything about it. paloma and roberto go to see paloma's friend paloma in mexico, where theresa tells them about the proof she found, but paloma is still sure she will be able to find it and bring ethan back to her once he finds out the truth, and theresa hopes he will divorce gwen and return to her.
pilar and martin plan to renew their wedding vows, but pilar is adamant that martin only wants to do it for katherine if he wants to, and if he only does it because he's helping luis and sheridan, then forget it. he assures her that he loves her, and he 'll always love her, but he wants a fresh start and a future with her. she agrees, and they make plans to meet with father lonigan to discuss the renewal. katherine, on the other hand, is having no luck at all getting past pilar, as she continues to push and pull martin away from pilar and away from the family. she calls pilar up and tells her to get out of her house, she's out of their lives forever, and she doesn't ever want to see her again. pilar goes to the crane mansion to talk to martin about the renewal and to inform him of beth and marty's whereabouts, but alistair stops her again and refuses to tell her where they are, so she goes to tabitha's and asks for her help. tabby, of course, is more than happy to help her out. noah and fancy almost come to blows when he tries to drag her out of the burning club, but she manages to wrestle him down to the ground and choke him to keep him from killing her. he manages to get her away from him, and when she wants to call the police, he reminds her what kind of trouble she 'll be in if she does that, then kisses her good - bye. she leaves him and runs right into tabby.
sheridan twists her ankle and can't go after beth when luis saves her, but she still manages to get on the chopper and get marty back to sheridan. alistair's assistant follows them, of course, but doesn't make it in time to see the helicopter. beth, however, does, and gets on it, leaving marty behind to catch up with her. sheridan is so happy her son is back, she forgets all about her own problems. rebecca and theresa continue to argue about who's fault it is that ethan is really sam's son, but neither is buying the other's act. theresa is sure she can prove she and gwen were the ones who leaked the information to the tabloid, and when she does, ethan will leave gwen and come back to her. meanwhile, rebecca is trying to figure out how to keep theresa out of jane's life for good, since that is the only way to keep her away from ethan.
theresa, whitney, and chad waited at st. anne's for the information the nun said she was going to give them, with no luck. chad went to see ethan, who was still waiting for theresa to tell him where jt cornell is, and tried to convince him gwen was the one who sent the info to the tabloid, but she wouldn't hear of it. she is still determined to find him and get him back, however. luis and noah tried to get spike to tell them where alistair is, but he refused, then tried to escape by climbing up on the bar, but was knocked unconscious by a rock and lost in the process. he managed to escape, however, and managed to get to the crane mansion, where he found jt and told him where to hide. julian showed up at the mansion to ask rebecca for a divorce, saying he wants to marry eve and wants her to give him the document he signed that made it impossible for him to divorce her. she agreed to his terms, then went home to tell eve the good news, but couldn't seem to get it out of her mind that he and rebecca are brother and sister. eve tried to talk fox into letting kay sleep with miguel one more night in hopes she 'll regain her memory and come back to him, but fox is only willing to go along for the time being, since he's the father of her child.
