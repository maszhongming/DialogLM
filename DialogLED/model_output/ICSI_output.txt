the main focus of the meeting was on the wizard data test, and the results were presented. there were some problems with the introduction of the new tasks, in that the system broke down and the wizard could not be heard. a tentative decision was made to hire fey as the first subject and start paying her for her work, and also to find ways of integrating the data into the existing smartkom system. there is also a problem with the presentation of the data to the linguistics group. the reading was too long, and there was a lapse in the wireless connection, so the group had to move closer. the next step is to refine the tasks and look for other sources of data to find people willing to participate in the data collection. similarly, subjects should be moved closer to the system to avoid re-phrasing the instructions. the system should introduce itself, when it's called. subjects should also be given more detailed descriptions of the tasks, so that they can learn more about them. the final solution to the problem of creating a bayes-net is to make the inputs more compact, so they can easily be connected to the mode and to the action type. there are ways to back off on the purity of your bayes - net- edness. a preliminary version of the belief-net was presented to the group, and it was deemed that it could be used as an exercise in thinking about the design of the system, the interface, and how it can be integrated into the system. in any case, the group should find ways to get the linguists involved in the system design, because to the extent that they are willing to contribute, that will be good enough. the group will meet again in the near future to discuss this. finally, the presentation on the new data collection system will be carried out in the next meeting, and will be followed by a discussion of the details of the interface and the user interface. as to the presentation, there are a number of problems that need to be ironed out. firstly, the reading has to be shorter. additionally, the wizard may have to be moved to a more comfortable headset to make it easier for subjects to take part in the readings. on the other hand, there is an issue about re- formulating the system for the computer scientists, since they are going to be the ones doing the majority of the work. however, it was found that subjects are not following the order in which tasks are being assigned. the tasks that subjects
the smartkom meeting recorder group at berkeley met to discuss the progress of their main project, the action planner module for the tourist domain of the project. the recognizer to parser interface is almost complete and will soon be tested on the entire system. it was suggested that the module should be called a "route planner" or a "dialogue manager" because of its role in the planning of dialogues and its ability to interact with the dialogue planner. similarly, the dialogue manager should be a separate module that focuses on the user's specific intentions. the latter are reflected in the actions that are carried out by the system when it comes to accessing, viewing or entering a dialogue. there are currently no plans to extend the functionality of the module to deal with other linguistic parameters such as the user's intentions. speaker me026 has been asked to look over tilman while he is changing the grammars to english and collecting data for the wizard experiment. speaker mn007 has also been assigned to work on the parser interface. he is working with ralf and david, and will continue until tonight or tomorrow with whatever to get the interface working. the final goal is that before they leave, they can run through the whole system input through output on at least one or two sample things. the transition diagrams for the grammar and action planner are being discussed. it is unclear whether these should be based on prolog or on a more in-depth model of the dialogue system. in any case, the focus of the discussion should be the decision making of the actions and the intentions of the user. the action planners should be able to take inputs from the input module and make decisions based on what the user has said. in order to make things easier for the user, they should have some flexibility in the way that they are encoded in the system. for example, if a user wants to take a different route to visit a castle, the planner should tell the user which way to get to the nearest entrance to the building. in the future, this should be possible to include in a state- transition network of how dialogues will be structured. the translation of the existing module into english is still a work in progress, and it is not yet ready to be implemented. the question of calling the module a dialogue planner or a dialogue manager has not been posed yet, but if there is resistance to changing it, then it is because of historical reasons, not because somebody actually believes it ought to be action planner. the function modeler consists of a
the main focus of the meeting was the presentation of the thesis proposal for the presentation at eml next week, along with a talk on the work of the group at the mpi in leipzig and their work on the bayes-net. also discussed were the most relevant aspects of our stay here, the translation of smartkom into english, the synthesis of the parser and the ontology parser, and the discussion of how the construction parser can be used in the context of a pre-processing pre-segment. the presentation was also expected to include a discussion of robert's thesis proposal, but it did not. in the end, it was decided that the presentation would focus only on the constructions and the construal mechanism, and not on the main topic of the talk, which is the ontological and metonymic context of the discourse domain. in order to achieve this, the group will need to find an example for the use of these constructions in the domain. however, the presentation will not include all of the details of the work, as they are still being fine-tuned. there will be a small number of slides that will be used to demonstrate the concept of orthogonality, and some of them will be included in the presentation. speaker me026 will also give a brief summary of his work at the university of washington and his plans for future work. speaker mn005 will give a summary of the presentation and give some feedback on the presentation, as well before the main slides are ready to be presented. speaker fey is working on the synthesis. after the presentation the slides will be put together with some of the slides that have been sent in.
the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed a number of issues relating to the work of one of their members, including the transcription of recorded meetings, and the potential for collaboration with other researchers. the discussion was briefly interrupted by the departure of dan ellis, who had been working with transcribed data, and was attempting to make a report on his work on downsampling. speaker mn007 and fn002 reported on their efforts to detect acoustic events in the overlapping zone of recorded speech, also known as the overlapping zones. they also reported progress in the use of the nnn to analyze transcriptions of speech, and discussed the possibility of studying transcriptions that have already been transcribed by other researchers as a data source. a tentative decision was also made to restart the recording of one session of the meeting, and to perform a preliminary discussion of some of the other research areas that the group are thinking about, and possibly some potential collaboration with others. the group also reviewed the transcriptions collected by the fet mike, and a prototype of the system that will be used in the future to correct the initial segmentation with the real speech data. speaker me026 reported on his efforts to identify acoustic events by looking at the directionality of the speaker's speech. he was also asked to look at a stylistic study of transcriptions done by one of his research associates, and make some preliminary comments about the work he was doing. speaker fe008 presented his research on inference structures for understanding of language. the need to build in, and linkage to speech event transcription, and in particular, the need for a mechanism for understanding speech/non-speech features. the transcriber project is in its current stage, but it is still early on, and should be completed in the next few weeks.
the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed digits, alignments, and the use of a lapel microphone in the recording of digits. digits were a relatively low-level task, in which participants were only asked to read a single digit at a time, and in which no other speakers were present. the group also discussed the sri digit system, which was reported to be better than the bellcore corpus, but also not as good as ti-digits. there were also discussion of forced alignments and the possibility of substituting htk for sri. a tentative decision was made to run a small amount of digit data, including digits, out on the same sri system as the corresponding digits data set for the aurora meeting. speaker mn007 and fn002 reported that the lapel microphones used to record digits were more accurate than the far-field microphones used in the meeting. it was also determined that the distance between the microphones and the speakers makes the microphone less effective in discriminating low-frequency speech from that of a nearer microphone. speaker me026 reported poor results for forced alignment on digits, with results ranging from 30-40% word error. the results were similar for digits recorded with close-talking microphones to those recorded with far- field microphones. a number of participants reported problems with pruning and adaptation to the htk system, although this was largely due to the fact that most participants were talking during the digits task. speaker fe008 reported poor digits performance on digits recorded in a close- talking room with no one else present. some of the digits were even worse than those recorded in the studio. in terms of error, the most significant error was found to be the number of words in a segment of digits where no one speaker is talking. in the background speech has to be continuous. it is necessary for speakers to have background speech in the middle of their speech. this requirement is enforced by the icsi system. speakers can not have backchannels that do not originate in the foreground speech. speakers must have at least one speaker in their background speech. the resulting error rates for digits are as follows : far versus near, adaptation versus adaptation, and adaptation versus non-adaptation: far is worse because of the room acoustics. adaptation also causes errors in vtl estimation. adaptation, as well as means and variances, and also in the means and variance adaptation. adaptation is important because it is required for the recognizer's ability to feed different features into the system. the front-end of
the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the progress of their main project, a new feature to detect voice- unvoice. the group also discussed a number of issues arising from the work they had been doing during the previous week, including the quals, the training of the system, and some of the decisions that had to be made regarding the use of the data. speaker mn007 has been preparing data for a speech recognition project, and is looking at ways to test the completeness of a set of acoustic events. speaker me026 has been working on his final project for jordan's class, which is a mapping from the mfcc's to the italian phonological feature, called coronal.
