the group discussed recording equipment and setup issues, recent developments in the transcription effort, other potential types of tagging to be assigned to transcribers, and the post-processing of meeting recorder data. the discussion was largely focused on efforts to facilitate transcriptions, including the improvement of strategies for transcribing meeting data, and achieving a better channelization of meeting notes. the group also discussed efforts to ensure that the recording equipment is consistent all the way throughout, and efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments. speaker fe008
the team discussed the potential for assigning additional tasks to icsi's transcriber pool, including tagging more fine-grained acoustic information, and discourse and disfluency tagging. they discussed whether they should change the headsets, or do hand- soldering on them. there was also concern about the type of equipment used in the recordings and whether it should be wireless or wired. the team thought that they could standardize the equipment they use, perhaps by studying the trade-offs between different types of batteries.
the team wanted to make sure that the recording conventions were consistent all the way throughout. they thought that it would be better to have transcribers use different tools to ensure that the data is clean. they were also concerned about how the recording equipment would be transcribed. one way to solve this would be to purchase another wireless setup with another base station and more wireless mike, but the cost of that would be nine hundred dollars for the base station, and eight hundred per channel.
the transcriber pool has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing. though, there is still room for improvement. the transcribers seem to have a reliable way of getting the data in through the sony radio mikes, as long as they are conscious of the batteries. although, the frequency listings on the microphones are causing concern because of the size of the files and the manner in which they can be segmented for speech/non-speech boundaries.
transcribers will be given channelized data that has been segmented for speech/non-speech boundaries to determine whether such pre-processing facilitates the transcription process. there will be some modifications to be done on transcriptions to ensure that at least a subset of meeting recorder data is available to the transcribers. the transcriptions will be divided into speech and non-speech portions, and they will be segmented into subgroups to be transcribed as well as dealt with in the future.
basically, the children, young people and education committee's meeting was about an inquiry on education otherwise than at school. to start with, nick williams introduced that local authorities had been working really hard on their exclusions and working with schools to ensure that the curriculum was broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system. then sharon davies talked about the team-around-the- family approach, which relied on universal provision. also, local authorities were working closely with social care and health colleagues to look at the whole package of support, which included
nick williams suggested that they had been working really hard on their funding and working with schools to ensure that the curriculum was broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system. moreover, they had reinvigorated their managed move provision and discussion, which has something similar to a team-around-the- family approach. in terms of collaborative working, they agreed to have robust systems and panels to look at the whole package of support, including the needs of the learners in their home provision, if it's possible. and they also agreed on the importance of bringing all of the agencies together to
davies thought the new act was early on and needed to work but he thought the government should pay more attention to it as well. david hopkins was also interested in how the legislation would work for local authorities to make sure that they had the funding in place to meet the needs of learners. he concluded that the act should apply to all local authorities across wales, and local authorities should have commissioning frameworks for eotas providers to ensure that they have the training and the expertise to deal with the learners.
darren williams suggested that one of the factors was the rise in exclusions, which he believed was related to the prevalence of asd, and trying to get the learners the right provision. in terms of david hopkins's opinion, the other factor was the lack of enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. the exclusions were also caused by schools having to meet the needs of learners in their home provision, if it's possible. besides, there was the additional learning needs sector which was adversely affected.
nick williams suggested that they were working very closely with the pru and the local authorities to make sure that there was a continuum of provision and support for learners. moreover, they had a team-around-the- family approach, looking at the whole package of support, including what the school could provide. david hopkins thought it was an ideal system, since schools had to have the funding to meet the needs of the learners and their families at the moment. however, there was still a lag in the system.
nick williams thought it was a challenge to make sure that the staff and the schools were well- equipped to meet the needs of the learners. there were some learners who needed more specialist provision. also, there were learners who would find themselves at home because they were not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting. so it was more complex than just the child behaving in a certain way or being school-anxious. the staff needed to have a team-around-the- family approach.
nick williams suggested that the team-around-the- family approach should be adopted in order to meet the needs of the learners. it was suggesting that there was a need for a universal approach. working with social care, working with health colleagues, and using professional learning, the team should be able to look at how they could proactively solve problems and support the families. because nearly always, the behaviours that are demonstrated in schools or in home environment are greater in the home environment. therefore, the whole package of support should be in place for that learners to go back to school, where it's possible.
nick williams suggested that they should look at the pros and cons of local authoritative frameworks. the local authorities can't speak for each other but they agreed that the pru sector had something similar to it, involving a multi-agency approach, working together with social care, working with health colleagues, and the welsh government to provide a broader range of measures. meanwhile, david hopkins thought it was a bit of an afterthought since the new act was coming into force, but he believed it was something that should be considered.
sharon davies thought that local authorities should take the role of quality assurance of individual intuition, providing that school staff had the funding to do that and that they had the expertise and the expertise to work more closely with the schools. it was something that should be taken into consideration by local authorities as well, since there were so many problems in the past about how schools couldn't meet the needs of students, and how they would respond to those needs. and it was also about that multi-agency approach, working with social care, worked with health colleagues, to look at the whole package that went into these families
nick williams answered a question from suzy davies and hefin david in a private setting. he pointed out that exclusions were caused by schools having to meet the needs of learners who were coming to the end of their statutory education, your key stage 4. however, it was challenged that some children might find themselves at home because they were not able to get back into the school setting. hence, the team-around-the- family approach should be in place to ensure that everything was in place for that learners to go back to school, where it's possible. then david hopkins agreed that
nick williams suggested that one of the reasons might be that they just didn't have enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. what's also important was that they need to make sure that they have a universal approach, which means working with social care, working with health colleagues, to look at the whole package of support that goes into these families and to support the learners. david hopkins thought they should have a team-around-the- family approach, using professional learning as well as using the expertise that they had within the sector. and they needed to work more constructively with
nick williams first gave a look at the challenge of training professional staff for special education. the most important thing was to make sure that the staff were well- equipped to meet the needs of the learners. then, they had to work more closely with the schools to ensure that the provision was broad and balanced, and accounts for every student within the system. the challenge was also to have a team-around-the- family approach, which relied on professional staff to help the families.
nick williams answered a question from suzy davies and hefin david, indicating that their school had a team-around-the- family approach, based on which provision was in place to meet the needs of the families and the learners. later on, nick willliams answered an question from sian gwenllian am about the difficulties that could arise between the money that was kept back by local authorities and the funding that went directly to schools. he added that local authorities were working together to ensure that the curriculum was broad and balanced, and accounts for every learners within the system. in terms of
project manager initiated the first meeting on the remote control project. the team members got acquainted with each other and project manager introduced the plan of the meeting, which was to produce a remote control that was original, trendy and user friendly. the group had some initial ideas on remote control design, including how it should be designed, bigger, water resistant, strong and furry with easy-to-find buttons. in addition, they discussed the topic of working design, working process and detailed design.
user interface drew a dolphin because dolphins were smart and cute and graceful. industrial designer drew a cat because they sleep all day and they were easy to draw. marketing drew a horse because they were pretty and nice. and the group agreed on it being a robust and water-resistant device. project manager proposed that they should design a remote control that was water- resistant, strong, and furry. user interface supplemented that it should be easy to find with a call button on the tv.
user interface suggested that the remote control could have a call button on it so that users could push it to find it. project manager agreed and added that it shouldn't be too many buttons so that they wouldn't have to walk over to the tv to use it.. and project manager also suggested that they could design a remote control that had some place to put it besides a base, so that it would be easy to put in the couch. but user interface disagreed by pointing out that the call button would be too expensive.
the team agreed that the remote control should be hand-sized, with enough functions and should be easy to find. it should also be robust and water-resistant. with a little light, it could be made into a light and held under the hand. in terms of the size, the team decided to make it 12.5 euros each. each remote control would cost 25 euros and the team would have to make a profit for each control. their profit aim was 50 million euros.
project manager mentioned that they should design a remote control that was water-resistant, strong, and furry. and project manager suggested that they could design a call button on the remote control so that users could always know where it was. but project manager also mentioned that it shouldn't be too many buttons so that they wouldn't use half of the buttons. to sum up, project manager said their budget was twelve fifty euros for each remote control, and they had a profit aim of fifty million euros.
user interface suggested that they could design a remote control with a clip on it so that it was easy to find. marketing disagreed by pointing out that it would be hard with too many buttons. project manager suggested that there should be a call button on the remote control so that users could push it to remind them of where the tv was. user interface responded that it should be with a sound function so that they can hear the signal. but project manager rejected this idea by arguing that a screen would be too expensive.
project manager introduced that the team had a selling price of twenty-five euros and a profit aim of fifty million euros. their target revenue was twelve fifty euros and it was hoped that they would sell two million units. the team members drew out their favourite animals to get acquainted with each other and discussed their opinions on remote control. user interface suggested that the remote control should be fashionable, trendy and user-friendly. marketing put forward that they should design a remote control that is water-resistant, strong and furry. and the team agreed on it.
the meeting began with the industrial designer's presentation on the design of the remote control. the team agreed that it was fancy with a learning curve and high quality. then, the user interface introduced the function of voice recognition and suggested that the product should be easy to use for both types of users. after that, the marketing expert used some evaluation criteria, including the price, the number of items and the sum. the group then agreed to give two points to each feature of the product and a one to three. finally, the project manager commented that the team should focus on another market and adapt the product to meet their needs
on a scale of two to three, with two being good and three being the worst, everyone gave a two. the group thought the remote control was not easy to use because it did not have enough buttons and was not innovative enough. in addition, it was not fancy enough for the market. then the group decided to evaluate the product based on the following criteria. firstly, the user interface showed a two for the function of voice recognition, and a three for the more advanced function. secondly, the group agreed that the casing was spongy and of high quality. last but not least, the product was not
user interface thought the remote control was easy to use because users only had to learn the voice recognition function and it was not complicated to use. industrial designer agreed and thought it was fancy because it had a learning curve and users could use it as well. marketing agreed but pointed out that the basic layout didn't offer too much and voice recognition could add a lot. as for the basic function, users would need to understand how to change channels and change volume so that it would be easier for them. for the advanced user, the function of voice recognition would be easy to learn.
marketing thought the remote control was competitive because it had a learning curve and it was easy to use for both types of users. user interface thought it was hard to learn but marketing believed that the voice recognition function could add a lot. industrial designer agreed and added that it was not too complicated to get used to. however, project manager disagreed and suggested they should focus on another market and add more functionality by using voice recognition. the group agreed on it and thought they had done the best they could.
the group decided that the remote control would be priced at 12.5 euros and that the material of the product would be plastic or rubber with a yellow or rubber case. the voice recognition feature and the scroll bar would be added to the product. in addition, the group thought there would be little added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions. therefore, they decided to use a double-curved case and only use plastic as the main case. as for the energy source, project manager proposed to use kinetic as the source of power. however, industrial designer pointed out that it could be more innovative by using the
industrial designer thought the product was fancy because the remote control had a learning curve and it was easy to use for both types of users. industrial designer also thought the material should be spongy. user interface suggested changing the casing, because he thought there was very little added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions. he also thought they should focus on another market segment and focus on the voice recognition feature which could add a lot. the group agreed with project manager that they could make a remote control that applied more to young people by giving it another colour.
industrial designer proposed that the remote control could be produced at a cost of 12.5 euros. in order to reduce the production cost, he proposed to use the same material as the double-curved case, but he added that there should be no change in the basic design. as for the material, the case could be made of plastic or rubber. for the function of voice recognition, industrial designer suggested using a scroll bar as a sort of shortcut. he thought the voice recognition function was easy to use for both types of users.
this meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control. firstly, they discussed the properties, materials, user- interface and trend-watching. they decided on the most important aspect of remote control device and decided that it should be technologically innovative and easy to use. then, the group discussed the life of the kinetic battery and whether it would be available in titanium or standard batteries. they also discussed the shape of the case and some details on the buttons. after that, they talked about the component design. in the end, they agreed that they should design a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.
firstly, the team decided that they could not use teletext, and that the remote control should be only for a short period of time to send a signal. secondly, they would leave out the voice recognition and the touch screen, and choose a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. moreover, a rubber cover would be made of rubber and it would be comfortable to hold. lastly, they decided to give up on the kinetic battery and to use plastic for the main case material.
the team decided on a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. they also agreed on the importance of the fancy look and feel of the remote control. as for the material, the team would use a combination of plastic and rubber. they decided on placing the buttons in a sort of array and they could have them in a set thing. also, they decided to give up on the kinetic battery because it would be too expensive. on the other hand, their remote control would be light and strong.
marketing did a market research study with hundred subjects and the general feedback from them was that the most important aspect was fancy look and feel, which was twice as important as being technologically innovative. then the group discussed the idea of a flip design and a different shape from what's normal for remote controls. they also found a trend towards a spongy feel to materials in contrast to last year. regarding the material of the remote control, the group decided to use plastic as the main case material and rubber as the cover. they discussed the shape of the buttons and the number of buttons. they finally decided that they should
the most important components are the batteries and the kinetic battery. the normal batteries are the cheapest, while the solar charging one would be the most expensive. the energy source would be solar and it would be left for aircraft design rather than for remote control. as for the exterior design, the group decided to use a flip design and a different shape from what's normal for remote controls. they would also include a rubber cover that would be spongy and rubber buttons would be a better choice than plastic.
industrial designer outlined the benefits and drawbacks of each battery option. the normal batteries were the cheapest, while solar charging would be expensive. moreover, industrial designer thought the solar charging was not suitable for remote control because most people have the light on in the room anyway. to sum it up, he thought the standard batteries would be the cheapest because they were more convenient for customers. industrial designer also suggested that remote control should be in a standby mode and could be put on the side when not being used.
according to the industrial designer, most current remote controls use a silicone pcb board, which has these contacts that are close to the rubber buttons, and when users press down on the rubber button, it will connect the circuit and send out a message to two different legs on the chip. the chip sends out standard signals, based on the user's input, and it's basically like wind-up radio. in the next meeting, the group discussed the component design of the remote control. the group decided to use plastic as the main case material because of the cheap price of titanium. however, they would adopt a kinetic
the group discussed the material of the remote control and the shape of the buttons. they finally decided that the case would be made of plastic but the shape and colour of buttons should be different. they also decided on a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. as for the location of buttons, the group decided that they could put them in a array and have them set in a set thing. the group also discussed the motion activated buttons and whether they could be made out of rubber or plastic.
marketing suggested that the remote control could be attached to a charger base and users could push buttons to activate things on the tv. the team disagreed with marketing on this idea because they thought the touch screen wouldn't work too well. user interface supplemented that it could be turned off after five or ten seconds of not being used. so the team agreed that it was something to be put on the side to think about. but then project manager reminded the team that the kinetic was a different shape and not the same as a mobile phone.
marketing suggested that the remote control could be in a standby mode and could be used while not being used. this might add to the attractiveness of the device and would not detract from the attractiveness from the whole feature. however, project manager pointed out that this idea was not popular with mobile phones and people might not want to lose it. therefore, marketing thought it should be left for aircraft design rather than for remote control. the team agreed with project manager and agreed that it was a good idea.
the group discussed the material of the remote and the shape of the components. they finally decided that the case and buttons would be made of rubber. as for the kinetic battery, project manager thought it would not be necessary because it was small and portable. user interface suggested that they could make a decision on it while they talked about the cover. finally, they drew out a specific number of buttons and realized that it wouldn't be a lot to land on one particular button..after discussing the components, the group thought they were approaching the high-end market so they should push up the price.
firstly, according to the industrial designer, normal remotes have a standard shape, whereas the new remote would be a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. secondly, most remotes get thrown around and don't run out over night. then, the project manager suggested that the remote should be in a standby mode and could be used while not being used. after that, the user interface proposed to have lights behind the buttons and an alarm for getting it lost.
according to industrial designer, if the speech recognition feature is adopted, the cost of the remote could be reduced to 12.5 % because it would only be used for a short amount of time to send the signal. also, the user interface suggested that the remote control could be put in a standby mode to save battery life and users could put it in a position to charge. project manager agreed and added that it would be a cheap way of changing the look of the control and people could buy a new one if they wanted.
the meeting was about the potential consequences of the covid-19 in canada. the members put forward several petitions to ask for further attention for the people in need, say, the children, the workers who would suffer unemployment, and the creators who made a living on artworks, and also many other stakeholders from all walks of life, trying to ensure the life quality of their people during such a harsh time. some of the group members mentioned some social problems, including the economic depression, racial discrimination, and social security, to call for a maintenance of the wealthy and healthy community in canadas. through the
the members mentioned that the meeting was about the potential consequences of the covid-19 in canada. some of the members wanted to know how the government would respond to outbreaks in various industries, and how it would support both the workers and the families. besides, the meeting also discussed the financial support from the government to various industries as well as groups to ensure equal rights of different groups of people, especially the most vulnerable ones. later, the members discussed the new law in hong kong and issues related to community services incanada.
the prime minister and the government were accused of promoting the harmful status quo of maintaining the ban on blood donations from gay men and trans women. additionally, they, together with the rcmp, were also accused of using the emergency wage subsidy to fund their own partisan activities at the expense of vulnerable citizens. the opposition party suggested that there was a need for a maintenance of the wage subsidy, even though the government had admitted that it was becoming obsolete due to the covid-19's impact.
ms. leah gazan asked for more action to be taken to ensure that boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism, and more of a credible enforcement regime could support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in the waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct. as for mr. morantz, he pointed out that the bruce oake recovery centre would provide help to thousands of manitobans to manage their addiction and reintegrate into the community.
the auditor general introduced that the rcmp had use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime which were set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the criminal code. this report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used. it was suggested that there should be a commission of inquiry to prioritize the implementation of the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. the bloc was open to the idea, but the government shouldn't wait for the commission to be recommended to take action.
the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness explained that the government was committed to advancing on the issues that had been identified by canadians during the covid-19 pandemic. however, the opposition party questioned about the allocation of cerb. the minister argued that the cerb was something of a last- resort and would not be carried out unless it was clear that the federal government was going to spend the money in the manner that it was supposed to be spent. moreover, the deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs explained that they were continuing to absolutely ensure that there would be no delay.
mr. daniel blaikie asked for more attention to the gba+ analysis to help distinguish between rural and urban canadians who did not have access to a strong and stable internet connection. this was an issue that had existed for a long time and had to be resolved by the government. at the same time, mr. blair introduced that the government had launched a new, comprehensive national strategy to combat the covid-19 virus. based on this, they had incorporated a new pillar in that strategy of empowerment to ensure that canada was taking action on this issue.
the whole meeting was focused on the design and design of the remote control. project manager introduced the project which was to create a new remote control, which would be an international one. then the team members got acquainted with each other and project manager gave them their specific roles. each group member drew their favourite animals and made a list of its favourite characteristics. then project manager told the team to keep the product cost under twelve euros and fifty euros so that it would be easy to use. after that, project manager announced that the product would be priced at 25 euros and a cost of 12.5 euros, in order to maximize the
the remote control would be original, trendy and user-friendly. in addition, the team would be responsible for the technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. besides, the product would be priced at 25 euros and a cost of 12.5 euros. the customers would be interested in new functionalities that don't exist in the existing remote controls. a list of its favourite characteristics were then made by each of the team members.. industrial designer drew a cat, while user interface drew a rabbit.
when project manager proposed that the product should be international, he believed that people would be interested in buying a new remote control with new functionalities that didn't exist in the existing remote controls now. therefore, it was necessary to keep the product cost under 12.5 euros and fifty euros. the selling price of the product would be twenty-five euros and it would be reasonable for the customers to be willing to buy. of the remote control, industrial designer said that it should be an international product which would be sold in the entire world.
the remote control would be an international product that would be sold in the entire world. the selling price of the product would be twenty-five euros and the cost would be 12.5 euros. each product would cost 12.five euros. the group agreed to keep the product cost under twelve euros and fifty euros. and they would maximise the benefit by keeping the cost of the remote control under 12.4 euros and 50 centimes. the team members drew their favourite animals and made a list of its favourite characteristics.
the group members all agreed that they had to work on the design of the technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. project manager assigned specific tasks to each of them. industrial designer was supposed to design the user interface, while user interface would design the function. marketing would be responsible for the conceptual design and also for the detailed design. and project manager would be in charge of the production of the new remote control as it would be an international product.
industrial designer thought the user interface designer would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control, so that the user could use it. of course, he/she would have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. the industrial designer was suggesting that users would be interested in buying a new remote control with new functionalities that didn't exist in the existing remote controls. the product cost would be 12.5 euros and fifty euros. the selling price of the product would be twenty five euros.
the team agreed that the industrial designer was a user, while the user interface designer was how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control. industrial designer drew a cat with eyes, while user interface design drew a rabbit. the team concluded that industrial designer had to design the function, whereas user interface designed the relation with the user. the project manager concluded that each of the team members should draw their favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics. international remote control would be an international product and the selling price would be twenty-five euros. the product cost would be 12.5 euros and
the meeting began with a short introduction to the project and a brief discussion of the features of the model. the team discussed how features could be extracted from the data and how they should be connected. their initial idea was to set up features along the lines of where someone wants to go and what they've said previously, but this idea was deemed impractical due to the granularity of the data. they then decided to add a middle layer to the model and add hidden variables that could help them extract more features. the meeting ended with some students sharing the tango they were working on and a short discussion on the belief-
grad b said that the team had started to discuss the structure of the belief-net, its features and how they could be extracted from the data. their initial idea was to draw features from the utterance of whether someone was a tourist or whether they are in a hurry. but this idea was challenged by the team for the following reasons. first, the `` nice walls '' feature was not binary, but the middle layer would be. second, the team decided to remove the `` admission fee '' feature because it was not necessary. lastly, they decided to add a middle layer which would include `` open to suggestions '' and
the belief-net would add a middle layer to the current model. it would include features from the utterance, discourse, and discourse discourse as well as hidden variables. the inexpensiveness of the model would also be added. a 'wizard of oz'style model would be added, in which features would be derived from the discourse and the discourse would be inferred from the data. a `` nice walls'feature was added. in the model, it would look for the probability of a vista, tango, or enter verb using the building.
the team agreed that the feature of `` nice walls '' which is a stand-in for architecturally significant, is not the same as `` landmark-iness ''. the features come from the utterance, as well as other syntactic and contextual features. the intentionality is a probability distribution over all verbs and other features of the data. it is binary, and the middle layer is based on probabilities from the discourse and world knowledge. this means that the initial idea for the belief-net was not satisfying. the team thought that they could add a middle layer to it that would allow them to extract features from the
the team decided that the middle layer would be a probability distribution over all verbs. it would be similar to a belief-net, in that it would have features that were derived from the utterance, as well as other syntactic information such as the verb used to enter, enter, vista, or enter.. in any case, on what basis the `` admission fee '' was chosen was not clear. the team thought that the `` closure '' feature could be extracted from the top layer.
the team wanted to figure out the importance of smartkom for the task. the team thought that there was a need to collect a lot of data for training the belief-net, so they decided to add a middle layer to the program to include other features that were not directly extracted from the data. for instance, `` nice walls '' was a stand in for architecturally appealing from the outside. it was also important for the model to consider whether the person at the screen was in a hurry or not.
the team decided to add a middle layer to the belief-net to include other features that were not directly extracted from the data. those features were to include `` discourse '', `` open to suggestions '', etc. in the middle layer, there would be features like `` nice walls '', which could be derived from the utterance, as well as world knowledge or situational information. a'nice walls'feature was also added to the program in order to incorporate more contextual features.
the whole meeting was focused on the design of the new remote control product. firstly, the project manager reviewed the notes of the last meeting and made sure that the team knows what the product is going to like look like. after that, the user interface designer suggested that the remote control should be with different colours so as to be more unique. when it came to the findings of the marketing report, the team agreed that they had to make a beautiful remote control to look fancy. eighty percent of users would spend more money for something good. while older people were more critical about where they spend their money money. what's more
industrial designer proposed to make a remote control for only television. marketing put forward a product for kids and elderly. user interface suggested a clap system, in which the remote control would beep when users clap their hands. then project manager suggested that there could be a button on the home station that would beeps when users click a button. then user interface came up with a idea of having a button with stripes on it, which could help users to remember the number of buttons. industrial designer and user interface agreed on it.
when marketing mentioned the fact that younger people under the age of forty were more interested in new features and older people didn't like new features, marketing should emphasize the importance of keeping the product simple for elderly people. marketing suggested making a remote control for television only and made it special because elderly people needed to use it. however, marketing's opinion was challenged by user interface who pointed out that elderly people were not looking for speech recognition and it would be difficult for them to remember the number.
user interface agreed with marketing's suggestion that the remote control should be easy to use for kids and elderly people because they don't like new features and have to make good zap buttons. it would be handy when users pressed one button and got on the channel they wanted. however, user interface also pointed out that there were already many controls on the market that supported lot of stuff, such as dvd, stereo and vcrs. so user interface preferred to keep the product simple and still only use basic functions like numbers and on-off.
industrial designer suggested a clap system, in which the remote control would beep when users clap their hands to find it quickly. user interface suggested that there could be a button on the home station that would beeps when it gets lost in the room. marketing followed with a presentation on technical function design, proposing to make a beautiful remote control. which was only for television. and user interface supplemented that it should be easy to use. then they discussed the mute button and whether it was necessary.
this is the third meeting on the remote control concept. project manager began it with a review of the market situation, then marketing, industrial designer, user interface and marketing gave their presentations respectively. marketing's findings were that innovation was more important than ease of use for the target group and technology was twice as important. as for the feel of the material, it should be spongy. industrial designer and user interface followed with a presentation on the trend-watching for remote control, and then project manager moved on to discuss some energy sources, push-buttons and scroll-wheel with voice recognition. after that, project
the group decided that the remote control would be made into a round shape with four push-buttons in a form of a round. marketing believed that innovation was more important than ease of use for the target group and suggested using a fancy look and feel of spongy material. industrial designer agreed and pointed out that they should use rubber as the material of the appearance. project manager agreed and suggested making a remote control which had a kinetic energy supply. the group also decided to use push buttons and scroll-wheels.
user interface and industrial designer did not make sure that remote control would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it. marketing suggested making a round remote control with round buttons for volume and channel selection. project manager thought it would be good to incorporate a sample sensor and a sample speaker. in this way, the voice recognition could be high-tech and make the remote control different from the traditional ones. marketing also suggested that they could make four push-buttons in a form of a round.
the team discussed whether to use rubber or latex as the material of the front side of the remote control. at first, they decided to use the former because it was much cheaper. but then they came to realize that the back side would be made of rubber instead of plastic. as for the location of buttons, the team decided to place all the buttons in the range of the thumb. in addition, they thought a push-buttons would be better than scroll-wheels.
industrial designer pointed out that the single-curved design was fancy and high-tech. it would be different from the traditional device and make the remote control look and feel fancier. also, the group found that fruit and vegetable elements were important for remote control, so the team decided to make it with spongy material. to sum up, industrial designer said that the team had some information about voice recognition and the round button for the channel programming and volume, but they didn't choose this design because it was not easy to use.
user interface and industrial designer disagreed with each other. industrial designer couldn't see a scenario where the user would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it, while user interface thought it would be necessary to make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall. hence, the group agreed that they should make the remote control with kinetic energy. marketing added that the kinetic thing was very funny. project manager agreed and thought it was new to the market. but marketing thought it might attract young customers.
industrial designer pointed out that scroll-wheels were easy to use, but project manager insisted that they should be integrated with buttons for channel programming and volume. marketing suggested using a scroll-wheel with a button on it to integrate some functions. user interface disagreed, pointing out that it would not be feasible unless the remote control had a round shape and four push-buttons in a form of a round. project manager agreed and proposed to discuss with the industrial designer about whether there was a need to use scroll- wheels.
when discussing the whether to use lcd displays in the remote control, the team found that it was not necessary to have them because they had the push-buttons and no need for scroll-wheels. then the project manager suggested using kinetic energy to power the remote controls. the group agreed on it and discussed it in the next meeting..after discussion, the group thought it might be a good idea to incorporate kinetic energy into the remote remote control.. but at the end of the meeting, they reaffirmed the decision not to uselcd displays.
this is the second meeting of the team. project manager went over the last meeting and informed the team of the plan for the next meeting. they decided that the remote control was only going to be for tv, instead of a combined one, and that they would reduce the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features. user interface designer gave the first presentation on the working design and suggested a flip-open design with a simple and user-friendly design. industrial designer introduced the team on the technical design as well as the marketing point of view, especially on the functional requirements. then, marketing reported their market research findings
industrial designer asked about the battery issue and whether the triple a batteries were appropriate for remote control. project manager suggested that they could get the smallest size to fit the batteries in. industrial designer responded that they had to be small and easy to carry around. then industrial designer came up with a flip-open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming. user interface suggested going for a wireless range of up to five metres which would allow the remote control to be suitable for anyone who's watching the tv unless they were in a cinema. at the end of the meeting, the team
industrial designer said that most remote controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue and because most people only use ten percent of the buttons. in addition, industrial designer thought that triple a batteries were the smallest possible because they had to be obviously small to fit the batteries in. he also suggested that they could shrink down the size of the control so that it could be smaller and easy to carry round. but at the end of the meeting, they decided to keep the battery problem on hold.
through market research, marketing believed that the current remote controls were not satisfactory in terms of their appearance and feel. therefore, the group decided to design a fancier and more fashionable remote control. in addition, they wanted the control to be available to a wide audience at a low cost. due to the budget limit, the team decided to reduce the size of the control. they would also add new features such as shock proof body and speech recognition to the control so that it would be appealing to different markets.
industrial designer found that most remote controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the tv because most people only use ten percent of the buttons and can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. in industrial designer's opinion, the alarm could help users find the remote control which was lost in the room. project manager agreed and suggested that the button could be a little panel that people could touch and it would let off a loud noise to let the user know where it was.
industrial designer thought of physically different designs when discussing the power source for the batteries and the size of the buttons. he proposed that they could use the triple a batteries which were the smallest in size. he also suggested that speech recognition could be part of the design. industrial designer also proposed to add a shock-proof body for the control and an electronic panel for further features. to appeal to a lot of people, the design could change depending on the market research results. the main functions would be on the top and the complex functions could be put in the middle of the flip-top.
the group decided to have a universal remote control, one handset for all, tv, video equipment. the user interface design would be a flip-top model. the main functions would be on the top and the complex functions could be put in the middle part of the flip- top. they would reduce the size of the control, reduce the number of buttons and add an electronic panel for further features. the remote control would be powered by triple a batteries and the surrounding batteries would be the smallest.
the meeting was mainly about the welsh baccalaureate. to start with, dafydd evans introduced the position of children, young people and education committee in this meeting. the whole meeting was about the status of the wel sh baccalureate, at all levels. at the moment, there were several problems regarding the qualification, especially at the level of a-levels. the members talked about several solutions to solve the problems, for example, adjusting the syllabus to better meet the needs of children. then the meeting moved onto a further evidence session about the qualification. at level 3, the students
dafydd evans thought it was a big problem that employers didn't understand the value of the welsh baccalaureate at present. john griffiths worried that the qualification was not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. while kay martin believed that it was important for learners to make sure that their employers got the qualification. what's more, suzy davies thought there was a problem for students to get their main qualification when they got to fe college, which was more of a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. given this, dafy
on the topic of welsh baccalaureate qualification, ed evans pointed out that according to colegaucymru, most employers didn't understand the value of the welshbaccalauresate, since it had turned into a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification. what was more, he added that some universities, for example the duke of edinburgh, might not recognize the importance of the baccalureate. however, in most colleges that had a-level students and high-level russell group universities, it was almost compulsory to do the wel sh b
dafydd evans thought it was important for them to understand that it was about what's in the best interests of learners, and the welsh baccalaureate was a combination of qualifications. then they agreed that they should emphasize the importance of the engagement of the employers as well. dr rachel bowen thought that if they could get more employers engaged in the process, they would be learning more directly from industry, which would benefit the employability skills and entrepreneurial skills. meanwhile, dafyden evans said that they needed to build the confidence of young people and make sure that they were
according to dr. rachel bowen, there were several opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than they did at the moment. the welsh baccalaureate was regarded as a rigorous qualification which had turned into a demanding one. even though it was technically universally adopted by universities, it was not adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. what was more, according to dafydd evans, many learners felt that there was a lot of duplication in school, and a one-size-fits-all approach wasn't going to work. besides, learners didn't
kay martin thought there was a difference between the skill challenge certificate and the welsh baccalaureate. the skills challenge certificate was a better title, she thought, because it didn't say what's happening in the tin and it was more of a assessment of the ability of a learners'ability to think independently. the baccalureate was a qualification that developed skills for employment, but it was not a compulsory qualification. what was important was that the learners got the skills.
to answer nick brazil's question, dafydd evans first pointed out that the success of the welsh baccalaureate relied on the understanding of what the qualification meant and what it meant at the different levels. at level 1 and 2, the qualification was used more by employers, while at level 3 it was not commonly used by universities. however, kay martin believed that the baccalureate was a beneficial endeavour for learners to undertake before their entrance to the universities, rather than a detriment.
dr rachel bowen thought there were opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than they do at the moment. the welsh baccalaureate was something that universities understood the value of and it was a combination of qualifications. but nick brazil thought it was not for everyone because some people had to do the other things, like gcse, gsce, etc. then suzy davies thought that many learners would have a negative experience of the wel sh bac in previous study. dafydd evans agreed and added that there was a new dimension lately
to answer nick brazil's question, he first pointed out that the welsh baccalaureate was turned into a rigorous, some would say demanding qualification, which was putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year. however, he also believed that universities cared about the quality of the education at different levels and there was no evidence that universities understood the value of the welch baccalureate.
when discussing the topic of whether the universities understood the value of the welsh baccalaureate, dr. rachel bowen pointed out that although the qualification was technically universally adopted by universities, it was not accepted by every admissions tutor in every university. and at level 3, there were fewer a-levels and baccalureate students because they were resitting their gcse at the national level. however, at level 2, there was more use of the bacc
janet finch-saunders believed that there was a difference in how the welsh baccalaureate was valued at the different levels that it was studied. nick brazil thought the skills challenge certificate was a better title. he pointed out that it had become a qualification that developed employability skills and entrepreneurial skills, rather than the skills for employment. and he believed that the specialist teacher-training qualification should be introduced to develop the professional skills needed within the professional sectors.
dafydd evans thought that the welsh baccalaureate was a beneficial endeavour for learners to undertake before their entrance to the universities, but there was not a need to introduce a specialist teacher training qualification. in his opinion, the skill challenge certificate was a better title because it didn't say what's happening in the tin and it was a more appropriate title. he added that the skills challenge certificate had more of a role within the qualification and was more appropriate for the position.
nick brazil thought there was a need to review the qualification, and he thought the skills challenge certificate was a better title than the welsh baccalaureate. he agreed with dafydd evans that the qualification was a combination of qualifications which should be taken into consideration. he also thought a specialist teacher training qualification was necessary, especially for those who would go to oxbridge or high-level russell group universities. he was skeptical of the value of the baccalureate though.
this meeting was about conceptual design. firstly, groupmates presented on the components design including a ipod-style wheel, the circuit board, a radio sender and receiver, standard parts, and custom-designed case. next, the user interface presented on conceptual design including the touch-based graphical interface, the material, the function of buttons, and the positioning function of remote control. then, marketing reported the current trend in electronics and suggested a fruit and vegetable theme for the electronics. after that, the group discussed the shape of the remote control and decided to make it like a fruit. finally, the project manager summarized the whole
current trend in electronics was the fruit and vegetable theme. the group discussed that people might like to have a remote with a fruit theme in their sitting room instead of a banana. they also discussed the material used for the remote control, which could be spongy and made out of rubber or plastic. they decided that the rubber case would be good to protect the remote and the locator. as for the technology, the group believed that fancy look and feel went far beyond the functionality. therefore, the material should be technologically innovative.
industrial designer designed a touch-based graphical interface system, including buttons, an ipod-style wheel, a radio sender and a receiver, a beeping or buzzer, an advanced chip, a circuit board, and a custom-designed circuit board. the industrial designer focused on the importance of fancy look and feel, technologically innovative technology and ease of use. in addition, industrial designer recommended spongy material which could protect the remote and the locator. the material could be rubber, plastic or wood. besides, the remote itself should be small and comfortable.
user interface thought that a screen would make the remote easier to use, as it would be able to show the menu on the tv screen. marketing disagreed with user interface, for it was believed that screen would not be necessary if the remote itself wasn't cluttered up. project manager agreed with industrial designer that the screen should be the only feature of the remote, while the menu button would be necessary for users to bring up the channel they were on. and the advanced chip would be more expensive.
first, the group discussed whether to have a rechargeable battery or a battery dock. the user interface suggested a disposable one because it was much cheaper. then, they discussed the idea of a battery compartment which could be inside the remote. after that, they decided to come up with a combination of both solar and conventional batteries. with this, they had a brief discussion on the choice of battery, and they came to a consensus that they should use one of the two. lastly, industrial designer mentioned that they needed to think about the space in the living room for the remote control.
the industrial designer thought that the energy source could be spongy. it could be a banana or a vegetable. however, he pointed out that he didn't want it to feel like a banana. so, instead of creating a small thing, they could just have covers and make the remote look like a bananas. the industrial designer also suggested that they could incorporate the fruit and vegetable theme in the remote control, as it was a trend in fashion, in clothing and fabrics.
the energy source would be a rechargeable battery or a battery dock, which would be attached to the charger base, and the battery would be installed in the side of the remote. in terms of the material, the group decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic for the case, and a spongy rubber would be better for the location function. as for the battery, there would be two options. one was a small lithium battery, the other was a regular one. the former was more expensive.
the meeting began with the industrial designer and user interface showing the prototype of the remote control based on the previous discussion of its functions. after that, the group discussed the material of the device, buttons, and background lights. they finally agreed that the case and buttons should be made of hard plastic, and the color of each button should be different. then, the marketing made some criteria so that the team could evaluate the model. through these criteria, the team got an average number for each function of the product.
the group made an evaluation presentation about the prototype of the remote control based on the team's discussion about the project. the group agreed that the prototype was beautiful because it had a fancy look-and-feels like the ipod. besides, it was easy to use and it was popular. then the group discussed the evaluation criteria of the prototype. they agreed that it was mainly about the appearance and feel, since the team didn't know how many buttons were required or how to design them. then they agreed to give a one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet
the team agreed that the remote control should be easy to use and learnable because it was aimed at new needs and the market. as for the material, the team decided to use hard plastic with round corners, colour changeable and transparent. besides, the buttons should be made in different colours such as black, grey and grey. although, there were doubts from the industrial designer on this point, since he didn't know how many buttons were required or how many functions to use.
marketing recommended to evaluate the model based on the analysis of marketing's research about the new needs and market trend. for instance, marketing suggested that the team should figure out whether the current market trend was good enough for the remote controls. and if it was not, then they should change the market trend so that the remote control would be able to meet the needs of the customers. of course, it might not be as good as the ipod, but it could be good enough.
industrial designer and user interface wrote down some criteria so that they could evaluate the model. marketing made some criteria as well, so they could test the criteria from one to zero. the group evaluated the model and then they agreed that the drawing board was necessary. after that, project manager proposed to show the prototype to the group and they agreed to use it for the presentation. then they discussed the material of the device and decided to use hard plastic with round corners. as for the backlight, they decided to put a colour light behind it.
when the group was talking about the project finance, user interface said that they didn't have enough time to design the inside and it might be necessary to add speech recognition buttons. also, the industrial designer pointed out that there should be a logo on the remote control so that it would be popular. as for the material of the case, the material should be hard plastic with round corners, colour changeable and transparent. besides, the buttons should be made in different colours such as black, grey and dark grey.
project manager introduced the agenda of the meeting, and the team got to know each other better by drawing their favourite animals with pens. then, project manager announced that the remote control would be priced at 25 euros and a production cost of 12.5 euros, in order to achieve a profit aim of 50 million euros in the first year. the team members shared and discussed their ideas on the product, and then they discussed the cost implications of the product. after all, they agreed that the product should be compact and user-friendly with a simplicity of design.
user interface and industrial designer agreed on the importance of making the remote control fashionable and usable by all age groups. marketing believed that the market range international included people of all ages. therefore, the design should be accessible to all. project manager agreed and proposed to add an lcd display and a menu display on the remote controls to make it easier to browse and navigate. the group agreed on it and mentioned that the teletext had got that option as well so that the design could be simpler.
industrial designer pointed out that the menu display on the remote control could make it easier to browse and navigate, but it might have the cost implications. user interface supplemented that it could also save a bit of space. so, industrial designer thought that with a menu display, the product could be made smaller. marketing agreed and added that it should be self-intuitive so that users could work out what everything's doing. the group agreed on it and mentioned that they needed to make it fashionable and usable by all age groups.
industrial designer thought that the older generation didn't use teletext and couldn't even dream of texting. industrial designer mentioned that the remote control should be made usable by someone like me, so that it could be used by all age groups. in addition, industrial designer proposed to add a lcd display on the remote controls to make it more visible, and a flip top remote control could provide a bigger screen when it was flipped over. project manager agreed and added that it should be self-intuitive and users could work out what everything was doing.
industrial designer thought that the material of the remote control should be made of plastic because it was easy to mould and produced. industrial designer also proposed to have a flip top remote control which could have a bigger screen when it flipped over. when it came to the industrial designer, he believed that the menu display on the mobile phone made it complicated for the user, because it gave users a menu to go into with obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.
project manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 euros. the profit aim was 50 million euros in the first year. the team agreed to target a wide market, which could include grannies to kids. the remote control should be compact and user-friendly. in order to meet the needs of different age groups, the team decided to design a cheap-end remote control which would not be too hard to find. however, it would be better if the product was made of plastic because it was easily moulded.
project manager thought the market range would depend on the price of the remote control. if the product was to be priced at 25 euros, half of the selling price would be taken up by building it. then the profit aim would be 50 million euros in the first year. project manager agreed with marketing's idea of making the product accessible and usable by all age groups and mentioned that the team should design a remote control that is trendy, user-friendly and environmentally sensitive so that it can meet the needs of different age groups.
the group had a discussion about the conceptual design of the remote control. firstly, the user interface designer introduced the three concepts of user interface, which were easy to use, sophisticated and attractive. next, the marketing designer gave the presentation on conceptual design. the group then decided on the final remote control concept with speech recognition and gesture recognition as features. after that, the group discussed the material they would use and decided to have a wooden remote control with plastic buttons and solar energy as the different types of alimentation. finally, the project manager summarized the whole meeting and informed the group of the plan for the next meeting.
user interface designer thought that the remote control should be easy to use with sophisticated functions and the user could use speech recognition and gesture recognition. they should give the customers the impression that the controller was attractive so that they could easy recognise it among a lot of products. the team discussed the material they would use to design the interface and the different components of remote control. project manager suggested that the material should be plastic with speech recognition technology and gestures recognition. with these features, the product could be more attractive and competitive.
the user interface designer thought that remote control could be easy to use and sophisticated to use with speech recognition and gesture recognition. it was a combination of easy to using and sophisticated functions. with this advanced feature, he thought they could attract a lot of users and make the remote control look fancy. but the project manager did not think it would be a problem because the vocabulary of remote control was very small. however, if the users wanted to use voice recognition or gesture recognition, they would be able to use it.
industrial designer thought it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or a fancy remote control. project manager agreed with industrial designer and project manager added that if the user wanted to use voice recognition or gesture recognition, he should choose the one with voice recognition. however, project manager did not think it would cost a lot because they would have to do some basic research on this field. of course, in order to attract a lot of users, the concept of intelligent remote control was quite attractive.
industrial designer proposed to design a easy-to-use and sophisticated remote control which was easy to use with sophisticated functions. in addition, industrial designer thought it would be good to have a remote control that was attractive so that the user can easy recognize it among a lot of products. based on this feature, the team decided to use speech recognition and gesture recognition technology. they would also use some cooperation with some research institute so that they could do basic research on this field. then they would decide whether to use voice recognition or gesture recognition.
industrial designer thought that if they could use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, it would be better to use one of them since it was more convenient for the customers. however, project manager thought it would not cost much if it was both of them. so, the group decided to use the traditional battery for the industrial design. but at the end of the meeting, they came to an agreement that they would use the solar energy as it was very convenient for people to use at night.
the team would have to decide which kind of material they would use for the material of the remote control. firstly, they decided to use wooden wooden wooden remote control or a plastic remote control like this one. in terms of the material, the team would use a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions. moreover, it would be good to have solar energy as the source of alimentation. however, they would not go for the solar energy because it was not friendly to the environment.
the user interface designer suggested that the remote control should be easy to use with sophisticated functions and the user could add some function for browsing in internet. the group discussed some cooperation with some research institute so that they could do some basic research on this field. they also decided to design a remote control with advanced features so that it would be hard for the customers to distinguish from other products. then they discussed the material they would use and which kind of alimentation they would want to have.
marketing recommended to do some research on the problem of fashion so that the team could do some basic research on this field. in this way, the team would know what kind of fashion the remote control should be with some advanced features so that it would be easy to recognize among a lot of products. besides, the marketing recommended to have a remote control that is international, easy to use and fancy with speech recognition and gesture recognition. with these features, the product would be competitive among other products.
the team would design a remote control which was easy to use with sophisticated functions and give the user the impression that the remote control was attractive. it would be easy to recognize among a lot of products. however, the team would not go for speech recognition because it was not reliable and there would be a disadvantage for it. for example, the project manager pointed out that speech recognition was not as reliable as the gesture recognition, but the team believed that it could be used to distinguish their product from other products.
this is the functional design meeting for the remote control. to start with, marketing, user interface, and industrial designer each gave a presentation on user needs, technical effects, and the working design of the remote. then, project manager announced some new project requirements, such as the necessity of speech recognition and the need of power buttons. group mates then discussed the target age group as teenager and young professionals. therefore, they decided to design the remote with locator buttons for their target group. after that, marketing and user interface presented on the technical design.
industrial designer suggested that the remote should be used only for television, no extra internet fancy things. and user interface suggested that they can incorporate their corporate image onto it. marketing supplemented that they should design it in a user-friendly and fashionable way. they also decided that the power button and numbers should be on the remote, as well as the channel and channel changer could be sold separately. the group discussed some details about the components and made some decisions about the functional design of the remote.
user interface thought that the finder button and call button were easy to implement but project manager suggested that it would be necessary to have a power button and numbers to find the remote. industrial designer agreed and proposed to design a button for the channel selection and a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself. project manager proposed to sell a separate base for this function and it could be sold separately for the remote to beep or vibrate if the remote was in front of the tv.
marketing suggested that the team could design a speech recognition button that could be installed on the tv screen to help users find the remote. user interface replied that it would be easy to implement. however, project manager suggested that a power button and numbers button should be added on the remote to remind users of where the remote is, while marketing proposed that a radio signal would be enough to send to the tv. the team agreed to design a button for channel selection and a buzzer for location.
industrial designer expressed a preference for a vcr or dvd capability button on the remote control, but project manager rejected the idea of a buzzer because it would be hard to programme. marketing thought that a radio signal could be used to locate the remote, while project manager thought a beep would be sufficient for the location function. the group then decided to produce two versions of the vcr, one with speech recognition and the other with no speech recognition. they also decided to design a power button and numbers for the remote.
the meeting began with an update on the bayes-net, which is going to be the focus of the presentation. then, the team shared some ideas on how they could further improve the model by focusing on domain-specific analysis. the thought that perhaps they could add another method to the current model and make it able to apply to all kinds of linguistic units. the meeting ended with some more ideas on the construction of the model, and a brief discussion on the paper that robert was going to present at eml.
the thesis is about how one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general, domain- general rules how things are construed in a given situation. the idea is to use the ontology, situation, user, and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilism relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what. the thesis proposal is about what kind of construction and simulation approach one could pursue for the analysis.
there is a potential to build a probabilistic relational model that has some general, domain- general rules how things are construed in the ontology, situation, user, and discourse model. this can be used to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what in the given context. there are two kinds of approaches : the embodied and simulation approach, and the general construal mechanism. the latter method can allow for a more detailed analysis of the underlying image schemas.
the team discussed how some of their recordings could be incorporated into a future thesis. there is a potential to build a probabilistic relational model that has some general rules how things are construed in the ontology, situation, user, and discourse model. these rules can be used to help build the probabilities. the team thought that perhaps they could explore whether it was better to start with a simple parser and a simple construction parser, and then move on to a more detailed analysis of the underlying image schemas.
the meeting focused on the conceptual model and some details on the components of the remote control. after the marketing's presentation, the user interface proposed to make a remote control with a fancy look-and-feels instead of the current functional one. they also discussed the material used for the device and how much the chip would cost. then, the group discussed the function of speech recognition and whether the case and buttons should be made of rubber or hard material. finally, they discussed the shape of the control and decided to make it like a sponge.
marketing introduced market research and indicated the most important aspect of the market trend was fancy look-and-feels instead of the current functional look. the second aspect was technological innovative because marketing thought the remote control should use some new technology to be innovative. the third aspect was easy to use. marketing expected the feel of material to be spongy. it was suggested that the case and buttons should be made of flashy colours such as yellow and yellow. and the component design should be with changeable fronts such as a sponge and see-through fronts.
when marketing mentioned the market trend of fancy look-and-feel, he pointed out that people didn't want to spend money on cheaper remote controls. therefore, a spongy remote should be easy to use and easy to learn. marketing proposed to use some new technology such as lcd or speech recognition so that the remote could be innovative. also, marketing suggested the remote control should be in the trend of flashy colours such as yellow and yellow to attract the young public.
when discussing the technology innovation, user interface recommended to use some new technology such as lcd and speech recognition to attract the young public. it was suggested by user interface that the remote control should be with a fancy look-and-feels instead of the current functional look. also, it should be easy to use so that users could use it without too many buttons and it would be easier to learn. user interface also suggested to use flashy colours which could attract the younger public.
industrial designer thought the remote control should have a fancy look-and-feels instead of the current functional look. marketing believed that the fancy look and feel was the most important feature. as for the technology, the group decided to use some new technology such as lcd and speech recognition to be innovative. they also decided to put their real reaction logo on the remote controls. then they discussed the material used for the remote controlling as well as the color of the front and back light.
project manager thought the remote control should be made of rubber and the material should be flashy. when user interface suggested the shape of the remote can be like a sponge, project manager thought it should be big enough so that users could hold it and push the buttons. but user interface disagreed by pointing out the power light didn't work and it was hard to use. then project manager agreed with user interface to make the remote big enough to hold and push buttons with one button on the front.
the team discussed whether to use a regular chip or an advanced chip for the speech recognition function. the industrial designer thought it would be better to implement the lcd as it was more expensive. however, the user interface disagreed with him because he thought there were more possibilities with speech recognition. for the moment, he suggested putting the advanced chip on the top, but the team later agreed to put it on the bottom.. when it came to the component design, the team agreed to use regular chips for the advanced feature and to make it big and transparent.
the meeting was the sixth meeting of the house of commons special committee on the covid-19 pandemic. first of all, petitioners presented several petitions including to call the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners, to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed rcmp-vetted canadians, to focus on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement. later, the meeting questioned ministers on the pressing issues faced by the government during the pandemic period such as the economic depression, racial discrimination, social security, and the environmental pollution. the government
hon. patty hajdu ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) introduced that the main focus of the government was to support and protect canadians during this pandemic, including vulnerable people. however, as one member pointed out, when the government moved quickly and efficiently, there would be gaps and they wanted to make sure that their government was able to fill those gaps. moreover, the opposition party argued that the government should not take firearms away from law-abiding canadian citizens. the prime minister disagreed, claiming that he had a mandate from the u.s. government to take guns from criminals.
mr. gabriel ste-marie suggested that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of canadians who needed it through the canada emergency response benefit. however, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and the government should try to fill those gaps. also, the prime minister was challenged by mr. dan albas that the federal government had been focused entirely on getting help to canadian when they needed it, and that had meant that there would be things that they would need to clean up after
hon. bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) suggested that there was a need to clean up after the fact to go after fraudulent cases. in this case, the government would want to make sure that federal workers were not disadvantaged if they tried to apply for the government benefits. moreover, hon. bill johnson pointed out that the government had been working hard to ensure that there would be no delay in providing the support to canadians who needed it during this pandemic, and the support would continue to be there for them.
ms. leah gazan asked about the government's support for the elderly and vulnerable people. the minister of families, children and social development pointed to the fact that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest way to provide income replacement to millions of canadians who needed it through the canada emergency response benefit. however, as mr. albas pointed out, there were still gaps. the prime minister explained that they had been working hard to fill those gaps.
ms. jenny kwan thought that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of canadians who needed it through the canada emergency response benefit. however, as the member pointed out, when the government moved quickly and efficiently, there would be gaps, and the government wanted to make sure that canada did not have those gaps. for instance, single parents and their children who depended on spousal support and child maintenance were not getting support. will the prime minister fix this gap?
ms. leah gazan asked about the government's support for the elderly. the minister of families, children and social development pointed to the ministries efforts to help with essential supplies and expenses during the pandemic. in addition, the government had launched a new, comprehensive national strategy to support the elderly, and had incorporated a new pillar in that strategy of empowerment to ensure that canadian government had reached out to as many elderly people as possible, and would continue to do that.
hon. catherine mckenna asked about the government support for energy resources and tourism and funding in green economy and small businesses. the minister of families, children and social development pointed to the fact that the government had been working hard to ensure that there would be no delay in providing the support for canada's energy resources. moreover, the opposition party questioned about the allocation of the large employer emergency funding facility. the government explained that it was focused on getting help to canadians when they needed it, and would continue to do that. as for the financial support for provinces and territories, the minister explained that the
ms. leah gazan asked about the situation of the tourism sector and the government's measures. hon. marie-claude bibeau pointed to the fact that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest way to provide income replacement to millions of canadians who had lost their jobs through the covid-19 pandemic, and had increased the amount of the canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. however, there was still more to do in support of canada's tourism sector.
the government said that those who had been hit hard by the pandemic would be able to access the wage subsidy, the rent relief program, the ceba and acoa funding. it was something that they had been working with provinces and territories to help those businesses who were dealing with lot of losses, and they had put in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before they loan money to them. the government would continue to work with them to make sure that they were transparent about how the money was being managed across the country.
this section firstly pointed out that some industries, like fishing and tourism, oil and gas affected by the covid-19, would lose access to the wage subsidy. later the minister of economic development and official languages explained that the government was working hard to ensure that those companies that had received the money would be able to access it, and the government would continue to work with them to make sure that they were getting the support they needed. next, the petitioners presented a petition concerning firearms legislation and regulation, focusing on the prime minister's commitment to ban the use of military-style assault rifles, as well as
the government announced that it would provide $ 600 million to offset financial losses in the fishing industry across the country. employers would be able to access the wage subsidy, and the government would continue to work with the provinces to ensure that there would be no delay. moreover, another $ 500 million would be given to the industry to help it go through the harsh time of the pandemic, as well as making it easier for workers to adjust to the post-pandemic situation. mr. gabriel ste-marie suggested that the government had also announced an additional $ 1.6 billion to support the
mr. gabriel ste-marie suggested that the province of nova scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations, which would increase environmental degradation, threaten established fisheries and tourism operations, and cost the merchants a fortune. the prime minister responded that the federal government had worked with financial institutions and the big banks to help canadians during the unprecedented situation. right now, they were sending money to consumers across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of covid-19.
this was a children, young people and education committee, and it was the eleventh evidence session on the children bill, specifically on abolition of defense of reasonable punishment. to start this meeting, barry hughes, chief crown prosecutor for wales, and kwame biney, senior policy advisor, cps, and iwan jenkins, head of the complex casework unit, crown prosecution service cymru-wales, took charge of answering questions from the group. at the beginning, the group discussed the divergence between the law in england and wales based on the legislation. then, bar
barry hughes thought there was a need to update the guidance because there was no evidence that the legislation was not working satisfactorily. the chief crown prosecutor for wales said that the current guidance code had a two- stage test. the first stage was whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. on the evidential stage, the cps would have some light- touch guidance around that, but when it came to the public interest, they would need to develop more with respect to that. the group would probably have two or three specialists trained in prosecution so that any case that came through would
the legal framework in wales included a range of offences created by the criminal law, including the children and young persons act 1933, which provided for offences that were specific to children. the more general criminal legislation, such as the offences against the person act, did provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. when it came to the reasonable punishment defense, barry hughes thought that the police would give more consideration for referral to the cps than beforehand, but it would depend on the facts of each individual case.
the first stage was whether there was a realistic prospect of conviction. this would go back to the application of the evidential stage, and it would depend on the facts of each individual case. then, the second stage was about the reasonable punishment defense. this was to say that it would be a defense for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. the current guidance did not reflect this, but the cps would probably apply the same test. in the end, they would decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it.
darren millar am suggested that the difference between the law in england and wales and in wales was quite big. barry hughes answered that it was hard to judge what the impact of the legislation would be in terms of the public interest. he added that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage and be referred to the cps for a charging decision. in addition, it was argued that children had fewer rights than adults in the current law.
darren millar am asked about the implications for implementing the bill in wales. barry hughes thought that the police would give more consideration for referral to the cps than beforehand, because there was no evidence that it was not working satisfactorily. in terms of how the service would approach it within the crown prosecution service in cymru-wales, barry huggedhes said that they would probably work on the basis that the number of offences were likely to be very small and they would have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that came through went to people who had a close network
darren millar am asked whether the draft changes to cps guidance would make things easier for parents and professionals because they might make it more appealing for them to bring a case to the cps. barry hughes answered that it would depend on the facts of each individual case. he added that the guidance would go back to the application of the evidential stage, and there would be no need to update it or amend it unless there was a realistic prospect ofconviction.
according to barry hughes, there were two stages in the process of out-of-court disposals. the first stage was the evidential stage, which was whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. in this case, they didn't think there was a need to update or amend the guidance. the cps would apply the same test to reflect the potential change in welsh law. the second stage was to decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it. at the absolute other end of the spectrum, the police would decide it was an offence that they thought was so serious that
darren millar am suggested that it was the first time that there had been an obvious divergence between english and welsh law, and it was hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the national police chiefs'council in dealing with out-of-court disposals. barry hughes responded that the legislation would remove a defense for common assault of children, which would make it more likely that the police would give more consideration for referral to the cps than beforehand. in this case, it would depend on the facts of each individual case.
darren millar am suggested that in terms of the infrastructure of out-of-court disposals, there were officials on both sides, who had been engaging with each other, but it was not a close-knit involvement. barry hughes didn't think it was necessary to have such a infrastructure because there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage and more people would be brought up to speed on the fact that there were some aspects of welsh law that diverge from english law. however, as a consequence of the divergence, there might be a need to develop more with respect to that.
there were concerns that the legislation would cause unintended consequences for people in wales and england, because there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage and be referred to the cps than in england. in addition, it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults, due to the difference in the size of the child and the way in which the slap was imposed. there were also problems in terms of the awareness of members of the public and how to deal with them.
darren millar am suggested that the group would have to work together with cps to come up with a final decision about the performance measure. barry hughes thought it would be likely that the police would give more consideration for referral to the cps than before, because there was no evidence that it was not working satisfactorily. in addition, he thought there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage as there were more people that would be reported to the police. however, he also pointed out that there was still a lot of work to do before the final decision was made.
karen cornish thought that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage as there were more specialists trained in this so that more people who had a close network and could talk with each other. however, the number of offences would be very small and they would probably have two or three specialists training inthis so that any case that came through would go to people who were close to each other and would have a close link with the crown prosecution service. that said, there was still a shortage of registered intermediaries.
the meeting was mostly about the logistics of collecting data for the corpus and how to structure it. the team discussed how meetings should be recorded, what kind of data they should collect and how they should be carried out. they were particularly concerned with how they could get more data from different kinds of meetings in order to train a potential summarization model. the meeting ended with a general discussion about the various types of meetings that the team should record and a few decisions that they should make based on the data.
the actual number of meetings that are recorded in noisy-or's can create a combinatorial explosion when setting up different microphones. the longer the microphones are, the higher the amount of speech that can be measured from each of them. that's the reason that noisy- or's are so expensive to put together..after discussing the cost of putting together different microphones, the team thought that they should try to collect as much data as they can from each meeting they record.
object representations will include an eva vector. this can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the bayes-net. as the project evolves, further enrichment of the ontology ( numbers of overlaps, amount of speech ) will be necessary. to conclude, it was suggested that the eva can be added to the database so that the team will know where to look in the environment, instead of looking for specific information in the television and radio waves.
as the data collection is about to begin, there are some minor changes to be done in the design of the experiment, the location of meetings, and the types of recordings that are to be made. a new procedural change has been suggested that the recordings should be made at the end of the meeting instead of at the beginning. it is hoped that this change will improve the quality of the recordings and allow for more accurate summarization of corpus data. of the meetings that are being recorded, most of the participants are graduate students.
the team wanted the data participants to minimize their contact with their data. they wanted them to recordings at the end of the meeting in english so that they could get a feel for the quality of the data they were collecting. they also wanted the participants to be cognizant of how their data could be used in their corpus as well as how they should be presented in the future. there was a concern about how the data should be used since it should be collected in different types of meetings.
the meeting occurred very close to the finalization of the model, so participants were focused on further experimentation they could conduct. it began with a discussion about how the backend model could be further improved. the team thought that perhaps they could train the model on different languages and then test on them. then, the team discussed how to improve their performance on the ti-digits test. the meeting ended with some students sharing the tangential fields they were exploring and a brief discussion on the different pronunciations of zero.
the training data for the multi-lingual task was mixed with different languages. the results on the digits task were not too promising. the error rate for the multilingual task was around ten percent, which was significant. the model performed better on the well-matched condition but worse on the highly mismatched one. the professor thought that the results were interesting because it seemed that training on one language and testing on another did not hurt the model as much as going to a different language.
phd d explained that the multi-lingual aspect of the model was not very important. the model performed better on a single language than on a multilingual one. there was less variance in the latter, so the model did not do very well on multi-language speech. he thought that they should try to learn more by training the model on more broad data than they currently were doing on language-specific data. of course, they would need to figure out how to reduce the number of languages in the model.
the professor thought that the results in the experiment without digits were okay as well. he thought that training on one language and testing on another was interesting because it seemed that the difference between three and four was not very big. he agreed that the multi-lingual aspect of the model was not that much different from going to a different language. the professor also suggested that their model performed better on the english part of the task than on the ti-digits task, which he thought was significant.
the model performed better with more diversity in the model than with fewer languages. the professor suggested that this reflected the team's priority, which had always focused more so on one language than on the other. the team agreed that they had to be cognizant of the multiplilingual nature of the model. as a result, their performance on the ti-digits test was worse. they also learned that training the model on different languages increased the error rate, which was similar to the bad results from the existing model.
grad f was working on a paper due on the 13th of may. the team wanted to know if the ibm computers were the same. the professor thought that they were not and informed the team that the pattern was different for each language. they had to be cognizant of the different pronunciations in the different languages. it was almost as important to deal with the hardware, which was different from the broad data that the multi-lingual model relied on. and the model performed better on well-matched conditions.
the model that phd b was working on performed better on the multi-lingual data than on the single language data. the professor thought that this reflected the team's priority, which had always focused more so on the broad data. he informed the team that he had ordered a hundred gigabytes of training data from ogi and they were going to start collecting more data from timit and other sources. he thought that training on one language and testing on another was not a good idea.
the team discussed the various institutions, like darpa and mfcc, that were involved in the recognition task. the team wanted to know how diversity of sound would effect their model. the meeting participants also talked about meeting notes and how to get meeting information organized. they were particularly concerned with how ibm could assist with transcription and how they would manage large amounts of data if they include more information in their corpus. finally, the team had a little discussion about how to improve their model for meeting recognition.
decision was made that the team would participate in a darpa meeting in mid july, where they would share the results of their experiments. the group would also discuss how they could adapt their models for background noise to the environment and learn from mississippi state's existing model on how to perform better on it. there was a slight increase in error rate for the current model, but the team thought that it could be increased as they learned more about the task.
phd g informed the team that phase normalization was working well on the sri recognizer, and phd g reported that the pre-segmentation tool was performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing. grad g was working on a paper due on the 13th of may and planning to submit it to darpa. there is a slight worry that the transcriptions would be too time-consuming for the transcribers.
the transcriber pool is improving and may be used in the future to perform other types of coding, e.g. a more detailed analysis of speaker overlap. transcribers are coding non-speech gestures, such as audible breaths and laughter, both of which are useful for improving recognition results. the speaker mn005 has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing... the channelization tool is performing well, with an error rate of 0.3.
a change has occurred to the segmenter. the pre-segmentation tool that the team has been using has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing. however, the segmentation tool is not performing as well as they expected it to, and there is still further work to be done in order to perfect the model and allow it to perform better on automatic segmentations. a change has also been made to the transcriber interface. the transcribers who have been recruited to be transcribing meeting data will be given channelized data that has been segmented.
the segmenter is working well, and may be used in the future to perform other types of coding, e.g. a more detailed analysis of speaker overlap. the speaker mn014 has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing. the frequency of each utterance is increasing, as the model has to be segmented for speech/non-speech portions of the waveform. there is a slight increase in error rate for the task, but the error rate is still good.

this meeting was about the remote control project. firstly, project manager introduced the scope and agenda of the project, and the team got acquainted with each other and technical devices. then industrial designer gave a presentation about the functional and working design of the remote, for it should be able to control a diverse subset of equipment. user interface supplemented that the remote should be visible in the dark and the digits of the buttons should not fade. after that, marketing reported new technical possibilities and impossibilities. group mates brainstormed some ideas about
user interface proposed that the remote control should be able to change the state of the tv, and users could also feel the buttons for volume and whatever. project manager agreed and supposed that the buttons could be made visible in the dark. user interface also suggested that the digits of the buttons should not fade as they are already visible on the white-board. project designer agreed and suggested rechargeable laptops were necessary. when it came to the infrared, industrial designer thought it was not necessary because all the tvs were equipped with infrared, but user interface disagreed and thought it would be a good idea to use infrared.
user interface thought a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment, such as dvd players, cell phones, video and audio equipment. it should be able to change the state of the tv without looking at the buttons. in addition, user interface thought buttons could be made visible in the dark so that users could know where all buttons were when it was dark. he proposed that white buttons with a black mark on it could be used. the digits of the painting on the buttons should not fade.
industrial designer thought a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment, such as dvd players, cell phones, video and audio equipment. it should be able to change the state of the tv without looking at the buttons. besides, there should be some interoperability between them, which could come in handy for users. industrial designer also proposed that the remote control could be rechargeable and should not consume too much power. in this case, the range should be limited.
the group agreed that the remote control should be able to control different devices. the project manager thought it should be a universal remote control for customers to buy new in a store. however, the industrial designer pointed out that it should not be a high-end product. therefore, the cost price was low. then the group discussed the use of bluetooth and infrared. they agreed to use infrared as long as the device was not pointed at tv. in addition, the group agreed to not use bluetooth.
industrial designer suggested that the remote control should be able to control a diverse subset of equipment, such as dvd players, cell phones, video and audio equipment. in this way, it would make it easier for users to operate their devices. industrial designer also proposed that the buttons could be made into glow in the dark and the digits of the buttons should not fade as it would be easy for a user to see them in the darkened environment. to sum up, industrial designer said the product should be sold internationally and it should fit every device.
user interface thought that bluetooth was easy to be used and that the remote control could work on different tvs or even different devices. he mentioned that lots of devices already use bluetooth so it would be possible to implement that into the product. but at the end of the meeting, user interface mentioned that there should be a restriction for the range as the range was limited when users were not able to point at the device. so user interface suggested that infrared should be used instead of bluetooth.
this meeting was about the target group and the functions of the remote control. first of all, project manager presented some new project requirements. they suggested that the remote should only be used for television, and that teletext was out of date and internet was replacing teletext. then the user interface gave a presentation about the design of easy and advanced remote controls. based on this, the group reached a consensus that they should design a easy-to-use remote control with fewer buttons so that the cost could be reduced. finally, the marketing presented new market requirements and suggested focusing on customers younger than forty. the group agreed on
user interface suggested that the remote control should have a simple and easy-to-use design with fewer buttons so that it would be easier for customers to find. industrial designer agreed and proposed to add a trendy design with nice lightning effects and colour colours. user interface also put forward the idea of having a rechargeable design or a energy-friendly design which could consume far less power than conventional components. in terms of the cost, the group agreed to use only one chip, infrared diode, buttons, chips, and circuit board. they also decided to use a low-cost circuit board because most of the production cost would
industrial designer thought that the remote control should only be used for television, which was the most important function, and that teletext was not feasible within the costs. in addition, he believed that channel selection, the volume selection and the teletext were the most commonly used functions, so they should only use the basic functions instead of another device. what's more, he proposed that there should be a central point to which people could go and perform some kind of report itself, which could save the cost for the team.
user interface preferred the easy-to-use remote control with fewer buttons because users could make a nice design when there were not too much buttons in it. user interface also thought that the multi-function remote control should be implemented in the design, but it should be a combination. and the lightning function was not necessary. besides, user interface pointed out that the market expected the remote control to only do one function and that basic functions should be the most important, which was to send messages to the tv set.
the group agreed that the teletext was out of date and internet was replacing teletext. therefore, they were not going to implement it in the product. then the project manager mentioned that they should only use infrared controls to send messages to the tv set. based on this, the group agreed to use a battery, infrared diode, buttons, chips, and circuit board with a low-cost circuit board. they would use energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components. and if they wanted to use rechargeable design or a energy-save design, they should implement them. for cost-effectiveness
industrial designer proposed to use a rechargeable design or a energy-saving design which could use more energy. user interface came up with the idea of using a base station next to the tv which could be used as an antenna. marketing further proposed that they could use a little antenna with a low-cost circuit board. project manager agreed and supposed that the remote control could only be used for basic functions such as channel selection, volume selection and teletext. in the end, they reached a consensus that they should only use teletext for the basic functions.
the team agreed that the remote control should only be used for tv. marketing thought that the channel selection and volume selection function was necessary, and project manager agreed on it. however, they would not use a teletext function because the board had decided that it was not feasible to implement it. instead, the team decided to only control the basic functions such as channel selection, volume selection and teletext. then industrial designer suggested using a rechargeable design or a energy-saving design. in addition, they should use energy-friendly components.
the meeting began with a presentation on the prototype of the remote control by industrial designer and user interface and a discussion on the cost and design of the product. on the basis of their discussion, the team agreed that the prototype had a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, easy to use, spongy texture and fruit and vegetable design colours. next, they discussed the functions of voice recognition and a beeper. then, they decided the prototype would have an inset black and white lcd touch screen and a combination of lcd and rubber buttons. the case material would be soft, rubbery and changeable.
marketing believed that the simulation found that the new remote control incorporated current fashion trends and was easy to use. user interface suggested that the remote control should have a fancy look and feel, technological innovation and be easy to locate. marketing agreed and added that the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable design colours provided a lot of customisation. as for the cost, the team had decided to use kinetic batteries, but they could also attach to the flipping open and shut function. besides, the voice recognition system should be simple and technologically innovative.
marketing agreed with industrial designer's idea of incorporating current fashion trends and the spongy feel of the remote control into the prototype. marketing also thought that the incorporation ofcurrent fashion trends would facilitate the user use, as it would be incorporated into the current fashion trend. however, marketing pointed out that there was not so much to gain in the competition of less buttons, as there would be many more buttons on the remote remote control compared to what was expected to be a high-end product.
the design of the remote control incorporated current fashion trends and made it easy to use. the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours gave it a fancy look and feel. as for the repetitive strain injury, the design was aimed at reducing the number of buttons as well as the size. for the most part, the team had agreed on the average rating of two. however, they noted that there was still room for improvement on the shape, colour, material and buttons.
industrial designer gave a presentation on the prototype of the remote control. it had a plastic body with a standard colour, rubber outer casing and an inset black and white lcd touch screen. the case material was soft, rubbery and changeable, with a combination of lcd and rubber buttons. the energy source would be kinetic batteries. the voice recognition system would be a standard chip and infrared sender would be on the bottom layer. on the other hand, the interface would have all the available functions on it.
user interface suggested the replacement of the kinetic batteries was feasible if the remote control was small enough. it was suggested that the cost of the new kinetic batteries would be minimal as they would be sold with the product. however, user interface also admitted that there might be a need to make further modifications if the product was to be sold as a prototype. the team agreed on it, and they decided to come up with a new design for it to meet all the requirements and reduce the cost.
the team decided to incorporate the voice recognition system into the remote control until they could find out more about the cost of things. as for the texture, it would be a spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. the kinetic batteries would be added to the product, which would make it more convenient for users. and the buttons would be anti-rsi and would be made in a combination of lcd and rubber. finally, the team agreed to add a beeper function to the remote controls.
the group discussed options to build an intermediate structure to build the belief-net, its belief- nets, and the types of belief nodes that would be needed to create an intermediate node. the final decision about how to design the intermediate node would be discussed in depth. it was decided that the endpoint, as well as the properties that can be derived from the ontology, should be the focus of the discussion. this would allow the team to figure out what features are most important to them and how they could be incorporated.
in the future, the team will be working with larry saul and rahim on a paper due on the 13th of may. they will be discussing how to build an intermediate structure for the belief-net and explain what kind of features are needed to be included in it. a 'wizard of oz'style structure will be used as an intermediate node. in any particular situation, it will be important to know what properties are relevant to the decision-making process.
in order to achieve this goal, the team discussed that they should figure out what features of the user that are most important to the situation model should be included in the belief-net. for example, they decided that the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions as well as the attractiveness of a building. there are three intermediate nodes. one is the endpoint, the other two are belief-nets, and the third is a program that will solve this for them. in order to make their program efficient, they needed to figure out how to incorporate all the information in the ontology into the structure of the belief
the location of the recording equipment was decided to be a special case. it was decided that the audio sign would be put in the same place as the recording device. however, it was noted that this might raise a question about copyright issues so the team decided to put the equipment in a different place. the professor wanted to make sure that the team does not end up in a bind. on the other hand, the device would beep if it was not put in a special place.
the group decided that it would be a good idea to purchase portable equipment. they ordered a hundred gigabytes of disk space though they thought an extra eighteen for backup would not be a bad idea. this was good because the team was currently constrained by space. the team also decided that they could store the data in xml for when they need to update the belief-net. this would allow the team to keep what they have without sort of scattering and use it for future research. they also ordered a few other things from the ontology to be inserted into the model as well.
grad b ’ s updates on meeting disk storage were that the team was getting four more drives. grad b also informed the team that there would be a bug in the system that led to confusion about where the disks were and they needed to figure out a way to incorporate this information into the model so that the staff wouldn't be confused about where to put their disks. he finally gave the team a general idea of the size of the file system they were going to be working with.
in order to get more space, the team decided to discard some of the disks that they were currently using. they decided to put all the data in one big disk. this would allow the team to keep what they have without starting over. as for the time being, a big part of the disk was going to be used to build the belief-net. in order to make things easier for the team, the professor suggested that they could talk about things in depth at the next meeting.
the meeting was mainly about the design of the remote control. firstly, the project manager announced that the team was going to make a remote control, which would be original, trendy, user-friendly and environmentally sensitive. secondly, the group had a discussion about the button size, whether it should be too big or too small. next, the team drew a favourite animal on the whiteboard and then they discussed the position of the buttons. lastly, they agreed to set the target price at twenty-five euros and to think about the batteries as well as the shape. then, they spent some time on the button
industrial designer expressed a desire to design a original, trendy and user-friendly remote control. to achieve this goal, industrial designer put forward that the remote control should be able to control different devices such as vcrs, dvd players, etc. then project manager proposed to think about the feasibility of adding some advanced techniques to the design, such as making it fold open and using a different form, but industrial designer later rejected this idea. to sum up, the group agreed that the design should be easy and small with a lot of buttons.
project manager thought the remote control would be original, trendy and user-friendly. he thought it would be good for the market because lots of kids and elderly were going to use it, and it should be with good quality. the project manager proposed to design a remote control with a lot of buttons on it so that it could be used from everywhere in the room. however, it would not be too big or too small in terms of size. it must be with enough functions.
when the group was talking about the advanced techniques on the remote control, the industrial design put forward to have a small-sized remote control with a lot of buttons on it to make it easier to be used. however, the marketing did not agree with this because he thought it would not be good for kids and the elderly to use it because it might not be easy for them to lose it. besides, he believed that a small touch screen might not work as well as a big one.
industrial designer suggested to design a square remote control with buttons all in the same place, so that the remote control could be put at the same time. in this way, users could keep their remote control at the right place to get used to the whiteboard. also, as a result of market research, industrial designer proposed to put some ideas on the remote remote control, such as the number of buttons on it, the position of the buttons, and the shape of the button.
the group discussed the button layout, the shape and the appearance of the remote control. they decided to have the buttons in the same size and on the same place, but the user interface pointed out that it should be smaller and more portable. also, the group agreed to put their favourite animals on the whiteboard and to draw on it a favourite animal. then, they discussed the position of the volume control and the menu control. to sum up, the team agreed to keep the menu button on the top and put the volume on the bottom.
the user interface suggested to have the basic things on the remote control such as volume and tv channels on top and the tv channels one two three four as a block and the volume on top, so that users could see. besides, a small touch screen could be put on the top so that the buttons could be always at the same place. the user interface also suggested to do a lot of testing to get used to the whiteboard by writing on it and making it look cool..
in this meeting, the team brainstormed about the look, functions and gadgets to adopt in the remote control and finally reached a decision on the new product requirements. the meeting started with industrial designer's presentation on functional design of remote control, followed by user interface's proposal on functionality and design of user interface. then, marketing presented new information about product requirements, and the team discussed how to meet the user needs with sophisticated functions and easy use. in the end, project manager wrapped up the meeting, concluding what had to be done by each of them for the next meeting.
marketing introduced product requirements. the group had a discussion about how to meet the user needs and make the remote control fancy. then they decided to have remote control with more sophisticated functions and less buttons, as they wanted it to be easy to use. also, they agreed to have a special colour for remote control. but at the end of the meeting, they realized that there would be no change on this, as the same amount of buttons would be required for the new remote control, but it would be different for different users.
their product requirement was to make the remote control look fancy, powerful and easy to use. the user interface designer and the industrial designer recommended to use yellow as the colour of the product so that it would be recognizable in the market. also, they suggested to have many colours for remote controls instead of having one grey standard, because some people prefer a red remote control. but the project manager did not agree with them because he thought it would cost more to have a personalised colour.
industrial designer expressed a desire to design an elegant, easy-to-use interface with sophisticated functions. industrial designer proposed a nifra infrared base with remote control with many functions so that it would be cheaper and more practical. however, project manager argued that a cable between the remote control and the tv would be too complex and cost more, so industrial designer preferred a wireless. when it came to the price, industrial designer thought the wireless was better for the cost and it was less technology. therefore, he preferred the wireless.
industrial designer said that the remote control would be powerful with sophisticated functions and easy to use with fewer buttons, so it would be easier to meet the user needs. also, the industrial designer proposed to have a nifra infrared base with an infrared bulb and a yellow bulb. there would be several options to have special colours for remote controls. however, project manager suggested that it would cost more if users could choose which colour they prefer. therefore, industrial designer thought it was better to have one grey standard instead of many options.
when the industrial designer proposed to have a wireless control, the user interface designer thought it would be too complex to learn how to use the remote control. therefore, the project manager thought there would be a balance between function and the cost. however, marketing insisted that it should be the job of the graphical user designer to design a fancy and powerful remote control, which was believed to be easier to use and more powerful than a simple one. and in addition, marketing suggested that fewer buttons would make it easier for the user to use.
in order to make the remote control look fancy, the user interface designer recommended to use the colour of the product, which could be yellow. also, he suggested that the power off button could be made in yellow as it was something international, something that could be used in the world of computers. of course, there would be some difficulties in doing this, for example if the user was not happy to read the manuals, then it would be difficult for the user to learn how to use it.
the group agreed that the remote control should be fancy, with several functions in one button. it would be easier for users to use if it had fewer buttons because it was easier to learn. besides, the user interface designer thought that fewer buttons would make the product look fancier, but the marketing suggested that it should be intuitive. they also agreed to use the colour of the product, which was yellow, based on the user requirements. and they decided to have several options, such as a personalised colour, in order to meet the user needs.
the user interface designer thought that the remote control was not easy to use because it had too many buttons. and the industrial designer thought the product was bad for them because it was often lost in the room. so the project manager suggested to design a remote control with fewer buttons to make it easier to use. but there would be no money for the design of the new remote control, so they would have to settle with what they have already got, which was what they called a basic remote control.
project manager thought that the remote control should be fancy, powerful and easy to use. in order to make it fancy, the user should use the colour of the product, which was yellow. project manager also thought that remote controls were often lost somewhere in the room, so it would be easier for the user to find them. on the other hand, project manager thought remote control was a job for marketing, so he would help the user designer to design a remote control with fancy and powerful functions.
this meeting was about the detailed design of the remote control. firstly, the group presented on the material they would use and the discussion on the chip and locator they would design. they finally agreed on using the regular chip for the more advanced ipod-like button, and the special chip would be inside the chip. they also talked about the button size and whether the base would be too big or too big for the user to hold. then, the team discussed the fruit design and production cost. they agreed that they should fit the battery case in the case and the batteries would be put in the back. then
industrial designer gave a presentation about the general shape of the remote control, including the wheel that users use to change channels or volume, the power button, the menu button, and the locator. the group had a discussion about the material they would use and the kind of chip that would be necessary for the more advanced ipod-like button. user interface suggested using plastic and rubber as the material for the button. marketing presented the detailed design of the fruit design and suggested printing the fruit in different colours. after that, the group discussed the position of the battery.
industrial designer suggested that they could make the base of the remote more comfortable to hold, and the remote could be made into different shapes. user interface disagreed by pointing out that it might irritate people if the buttons were in different colours. marketing supplemented that it would cost more to produce different colours because they were irregular. project manager agreed and suggested printing the fruit on fruit. eventually, the group agreed to do that, but only if they could fit the battery case in there somehow.
project manager began a detailed design meeting with the group's discussion on the design of the remote control. the group discussed some details on the appearances and those details were then further discussed by marketing, industrial designer, user interface, and project manager. they all agreed that the current design was okay as it was hand-held and easy to use, but there was still room for creativity. as for the material used on the remote, the group decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic with one small part used in one special color. also, the location chip would be made in a special colour. later on, the
firstly, the group thought that the remote control would be hand-held, so it would be important to make it comfortable to use. however, the user interface suggested that the base would be larger for the users to hold it in hand. secondly, some of the buttons could be made in different colours, but it would probably cost more to produce because they were irregular. moreover, the fruit design could also be based on market trends found in marketing reports and in the company strategy marketing.
project manager thought the group members can't all fairly comment on leadership because project manager was the leader, and the other member's experience of leadership wasn't as much as the project manager. though, the group agreed that project manager showed good leadership and that was a must during the teamwork process. besides, project manager believed that the group should focus on the progress of the project and not so much on each other's opinions.. the group thought project manager had a lot of room for creativity since he was not the leader.
the group thought that the presentation materials should be easy to hold and not too big. industrial designer suggested that the case should be made of rubber and the buttons could be made in different colours. user interface suggested that they could make the touch pad in different shapes, but this might irritate people if they got used to having the buttons in one shape. meanwhile, marketing suggested printing the fruit in different colors and it would probably cost more to produce, because they were irregular. the group agreed on it.
the meeting with the children, young people and education committee was mainly about the welsh government's progress in developing the new curriculum for wales. to start with, kirsty williams am indicated that there was a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year and it would be published in january 2020. meanwhile, claire bennett, who is the deputy director for curriculum and assessment, introduced that there had been several modifications to the draft curriculum to meet the needs of all the learners. also, it was suggested that there were further aspects to be included in the primary legislation than just the four
according to kirsty williams am, there would be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year, which would be published in january 2020, and every school would have the opportunity to engage with it. in the same time, a final set of standards would be put on the face of the bill and a mapping exercise would be carried out to clearly identify the gaps and opportunities to adapt the curriculum to meet the needs of children in each area of learning and experience. one of the consistent worries that some people had had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, was how do they get
according to kirsty williams, there would be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. it would be published in january 2020, and every school would have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. in terms of the legislation, it was agreed that rse should be included to the curriculum, as well as the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency. there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. moreover, there was a need to ensure that the profession was ready to deliver a
according to kirsty williams am, what mattered was that there was a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year, which would be published in january 2020, and every school would have the opportunity to engage with it. then, as for religious education, there had been a significant number of people that expressed concerns about the approaches towards re that the government had set out in the white paper. there were mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in the area of learning. many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger and exclusive focus on christ
kirsty williams am introduced that the government had listened to stakeholders'concerns regarding proposals for changes to the curriculum. it was suggested that changes should be made to reflect the balance between individual autonomy in the school and the national expectation. one of the consistent worries that some people had had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, was how do they get that balance between individuality and national expectation? for instance, if a child's parents had certain views, those were to be respected. meanwhile, the government believed that re should be a compulsory part of the curriculum and the nation should modernize the curriculum to
sian gwenllian am asked about the purpose of the distinction in schools and who should be responsible for it. kirsty williams am explained that the wiserd research suggested that there was a need for learners to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. therefore, re should be a compulsory part of the curriculum and students should have access to it at a national level. with regard to rse, the key messages were focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the program. there were strong views that it should be parents alone that made
according to kirsty williams, he was not quite in favor of the model of scotland yet, for it was still not clear about how they would deliver it. however, he explained that they were looking to a wholesale review of the curriculum at the national level. what they were seeing was a need for a broad-based, encompassing curriculum to cover different world views. which meant that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger focus on christianity, as well as including other world religions.
kirsty williams am mentioned that the money would be spent on a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year, which was expected to be published in january 2020, and every school would have the opportunity to engage with it. in the following steps, a final curriculum would be published on the face of the bill in janet 2020, followed by a final assessment by qi practitioners. by november, the editorial process would be engaged to draw up the final example.
according to kirsty williams am, 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have had an opportunity to participate in those events, and in the region of 6.000 head teachers, teachers, governors and teacher assistants have actually had an opportunities to participation in the professional development preparation. moreover, there had been 24 focus groups that had been arranged for children and young people. there was a concerted effort to ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. besides, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and
according to kirsty williams am, there would be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year where schools would have the opportunity to be really engaging with it. a final version would be published in january 2020, and every school would be able to read it. in the following steps, the quality improvement practitioners, the qi practitioners, would be recruited to work with the curriculum and assessment group. by november, they would be expected to have completed their work and would be in a position to hand over the refinements to the editorial process.
according to kirsty williams am, there were strong views that it should be the parents who made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. moreover, people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger, and in some cases exclusive focus on christianity as opposed to including other world religions.
according to kirsty williams am, there were four purposes in the welsh dimension. first, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation, as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with. secondly, there would be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. in this case, it would be published in january 2020, and the final curriculum would have the status of something that's not optional for a school. lastly, one of the two main new areas that they were now working on were to ensure that
according to kirsty williams am, hefin david am suggested that there should be a single continuum of learning with regard to the welsh language, with the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency included in that area of learning. also, it was agreed that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger, and in some cases exclusive focus on christianity as opposed to other world religions. there was also a need for the curriculum to be broad-based and encompassing of world views and world languages.
the meeting began with an update on the mississippi state recognizer. the team had started working on it and was tweaking it to see what could be done to improve results. the meeting ended with the team discussing how they could improve performance on the aurora task by taking account of noise. the professor suggested that they could start analysing what the noise was doing to the model by looking at the spectral subtraction of different reverberation techniques. the project ended with a few more updates on the recognizer and a brief discussion on the mel scale.
the team discussed how various features could be removed to make the model more robust. they thought that perhaps they could incorporate speaker adaptation into the model. the professor noted that this might not be a bad idea. the team also discussed whether it would be a good idea to remove features from the model that were not performing as well as they were expected to, and start over. they discussed how to improve the performance of the model by removing features that are not as good as they are.
the professor thought that the neural net seemed to be performing well on the mississippi state recognizer. he thought that some modifications were needed to take account of noise. he was skeptical that changing a few small features would result in a good improvement, but he thought it was worth looking into. he informed the team that he had some ideas on how they could improve the performance of the recognizer by taking into account noise-related features. the professor also suggested that their model was performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of data.
the team thought that the most noisy cases were due to reverberation. in one of the cases, the reverberation was so high that the model could not cope with it. in the other case, the noise was too high for the model to work. the professor suggested that the team should high-pass filter the data from the room to improve the signal-to- noise ratio, but the team was not sure if that was the best idea. the team also discussed whether they should eliminate noise at all.
the team had started working on the mississippi state recognizer. the results were from a test set of vad results. the team thought that their model was better now since it had lower latencies. they were concerned that the aurora system would not work as well as the other one. the professor thought that the team's intuition was leading them to make statistical characterizations of what was missing from the spectral envelope. they could use things they were potentially losing in the smoothing process.
the professor thought that the team was too stuck on intuitions based on only the channelized version of the model. he thought that they should try learning more about different feature sets. he himself wanted to try out playing with msg and multi-band. and he also thought that he could explore whether it was better to have one channel for speech recognition or multiple channels for speech recognizer. to sum it up, if the team could figure out a way to deal with this problem, they would take it into a larger forum.
phd c informed the team that the latency of the vad was too large. the team was using artificial reverberation to improve the latency, but the results were not too promising. there was a lot of noise in the environment. phd c thought that the team should high-pass filter the noise from the room as well as perform noise-processing on the recordings. he thought that this would improve the performance of the recognizer. to sum up, the model is better now due to lower latencies.
the meeting began with an update on the aurora project. the team was thinking about the various bugs that they had to deal with as well as how to solve them. the meeting ended with a few more ideas on how they could further improve the model, perhaps by focusing more so on msg and multi-band. the model itself improved by twenty- two percent by adding endpoint information to the baseline. the vad of the team's model did not do very well with a different time constant, so they decided to abandon the lapel. after a brief discussion about vad, the team thought they were approaching the
the team was setting up a new project in which they would have to run jobs at one time. the team thought that it would be a good idea to evaluate how they should run the jobs. they discussed whether they should use the same time constant for the microphone, or need to change the value of the update factor. they also discussed how they could improve the spectral subtraction style of the microphones. the meeting ended with some students sharing the tangential fields they were exploring and a brief discussion on the aurora project.
phd f thought that it was better to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with. phd f wanted to know how much the computational resources would cost since there would be more resources for computational resources. ph d f inquired into how the math could be cheaper since people would have to use more computational resources to run their jobs. he thought that `` run command '' did not allow for sufficient parallelization, as the time constant it used was not sufficient for the task.
the professor said that the workshop was mostly about aurora and some future directions for the team. the team had started using p- make and customs to run their jobs, but there was still further work to do. the professor also informed the team of some ibm processors that were available to them at the university of washington. they were going to use them to run some jobs. finally, the professor told the team about a in-the-round discussion with the professor about how to run a job.
the team was thinking about the best way to incorporate spectral subtraction. they considered using p- make for that it was more efficient. but the team also discussed whether it would be better to have a standard that people use and then interact with. the team thought that perhaps they could leave the spectral subt subtraction to someone else. however, they also thought that this might not be a good idea since someone might need to use it to train for a particular task.. so, they decided to leave this question aside and move on with the meeting.
the team thought that the person in grenada was using a lot of speech from home and they did not want to use the speech outside of it. they were concerned that there would be some errors in the spectral subtraction. they wanted to make sure that the speech did not interfere with each other. the team also wanted to ensure that the team did not end up in a situation that they had to cut down thelapel, as that would entail losing time for the team.
the professor recalled that the wiener filter had a feature that made it easier to control how many jobs could be run at once. it was possible to run a hundred jobs at a time. however, it did not allow for parallelization, which was much desired. the professor also informed the team that he had been working on a paper due on the 13th of may. he was working on using the wien filter to control jobs by controlling how many machines could be used at one time.
this is the second meeting with detailed design meeting. firstly, project manager gave the presentation on the project presentation. the user interface designer and industrial designer introduced the product which was a mushroom design with yellow and red colour and incorporated a microphone array. next, marketing introduced three key points of the remote control design. first, it should be fancy with a fancy look and feel. second, it needed to be easy to use and technologically innovative. lastly, it was required to be user-friendly. after that, the group discussed the button layout and decided to lose the number of buttons.
the group agreed that the product was fancy because it had a unique shape and colour. also, the group thought it was easy to use. although, there were two problems with the product appearance. first, it was hard to find the channel with the circle button and then the user interface didn't know how to use the button to change the channel. besides, the shape of the remote control was not attractive. therefore, the team agreed to make some changes on the design, such as making the shape more fruit-based and reducing some buttons.
the user interface thought the basic colour was yellow and red because yellow was their company colour, and red was more attractive. when discussing the product appearance, the user interface did not want to incorporate the fruit and vegetable aspect into the remote control because nobody would eat it and it would be hard to integrate with different colours. besides, theuser interface suggested the scale was smaller than the traditional one, which meant it was easier to control. in addition, the users could now control the scale by pushing zero after the first one and one after the second.
when the user interface designer suggested putting the remote control in a bowl shape, the marketing thought it would be not attractive because the shape was not easy to use. the marketing believed that if the remote controls were to be made in a fruit and vegetable shape, nobody would eat it, because it would not be easy to integrated with fruits and vegetables. therefore, the customer would not make a decision to change the product by putting it in a fruity shape or a yellow colour.. after all the designers agreed on the appearance, the product would be in a triangle shape and yellow was the company colour.
industrial designer thought the remote control was fancy because it was unique with a unique shape and colour. user interface thought it was easy to use because users did not need to put a button to change channels. marketing thought it were easy because they had a microphone array in the core to capture the voice from different directions. however, project manager thought the function of voice recognition was too fast. therefore, the product was not suitable for production. after that, the group agreed to discuss some details about the button layout and reduce the number of buttons.
marketing thought the design was technologically innovative because it had a microphone array embedded in the remote control, which could capture voice from different directions. industrial designer agreed it was easy to use, while user interface thought it was difficult to use. user interface supplemented that it was easier than a traditional controller. since users did not have to put a button to change channels, it would be easier with a scale. besides, it was believed that the round remote control was unique and technologically innovative.
when the user interface designer thought the remote control was easy to use, the marketing and the industrial designer didn't agree with her. they thought it was difficult to use since the users had to put a button to change channels and it was hard to find the channel. however, the project manager thought it would be convenient for users to go through all the channels if they wanted to turn on a channel. also, he thought this remote control had too many buttons and was too fast.
at first, industrial designer pointed out that the remote control should be fancy because it was unique in shape and colour, with fruit and vegetable elements. marketing agreed that it was fancy because of the way it was designed. then, marketing asked industrial designer to define fancy. the industrial designer answered that it should be easy to use. after that, the user interface designer mentioned some details about the functions of industrial design, such as the circle channel selection and microphone array. this function was challenged by user interface and industrial designer, who disagreed with each other on how to use the function. finally, project manager suggested using a solar cell
industrial designer said the solar cell was a revolutionary solar receptor that could be put on the remote control so that it would not increase the price. however, project manager thought it would be too fast so the group decided to keep the solar cells. marketing thought it was necessary because when users were zapping, they were changing from one channel to the other without putting a button. while in traditional controller, the user had to put a button to change the channel. but in this remote control, users could just change.
the marketing thought the remote control was not easy to use and was too fast. the industrial designer disagreed with this because it was easier to use than the traditional remote control. in addition, he thought the marketing's idea of turning on and off was not feasible. however, the user interface argued that he could use the turn off button to change the channel and it was depend on the angle of the turned-on button. there were several key features of the product so the marketing was not convinced it was the best way to jump from one to twenty.
